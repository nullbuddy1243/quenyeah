# quenya 

dir includes word lists from: [quenya wordlists](https://folk.uib.no/hnohf/wordlists.htm) 

from that site:
```
These wordlists (I should not call them "dictionaries", which would be something more ambitious) are available:
Quenya-English (quenya-english-words)
English-Quenya (english-quenya-words)
Quenya Reverse Wordlist (quenya-back)

The latter lists Quenya words written backwards, so that words that rhyme or have the same endings are grouped together (useful both for poets and for people studying Quenya derivational endings).
