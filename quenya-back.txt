Quenya Reverse Wordlist

	a a (1) vocative particle "O" in a vanimar "O beautiful ones" (LotR3:VI ch. 6, translated in Letters:308)
	a a (2) "and", a variant of ar occurring in Fíriel's Song (that also has ar; a seems to be used before words in f-, but it is not known whether this idea is valid in mature Quenya)
	a a (3), also á, imperative particle: a laita, laita te! "[o] bless them, bless them!", á vala Manwë! "may Manwë order it!", literally *"o rule Manwë!" (see laita, vala for reference)
a a- (1) prefix occurring in the word Atalante, said to denote "complete". Probably just a prefixed stemvowel; cf. ANÁR, said to be derived from NAR. (TALÁT)
	a a- (2) a prefix occurring in the Markirya poem (Tolkien first used na-, then changed it). It is prefixed to verbal stems following a word that is the object of sense-verbs like "see" and "hear" and describes what the object is doing, as in man cenuva lumbor ahosta[?] (changed from na-hosta), "who shall see the clouds gather?" (hosta = "gather").
	ablo olba "branch" (PM:340; the form *olva may be more frequent; olba can only occur in the Quenya variant that uses lb for lv. The Etymologies, stem GÓLOB, has olwa. See also olvar.)
	abma amba "up, upwards" (adv.) (AM2  (UNU) )
	abmal lamba "tongue" (physical tongue, while lambë = "language") (WJ:394, LAB)
	abman namba "a hammer" (NDAM), verb namba- "to hammer" (NDAM)
	abmar ramba "wall" (RAM, SA)
	abmarulI #Iluramba pl. Ilurambar "Walls of the World" (IL, RAMBÂ)

	abmol lomba "secret" (LT1:255)
	abmor romba "horn, trumpet" (ROM)
	abmut tumba "deep valley" (Letters:308; SA:tum and TUB gives tumbo "valley, deep valley"); apparently an extended form *tumbalë in tumbalemorna "deepvalleyblack" or (according to SA:tum) "black deep valley", also tumbaletaurëa "deepvalleyforested"; see Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna... 
ác cá ("kâ") "jaw" (GL:37; later sources give anca)

	acár ráca ("k") "wolf" (DARÁK)

accuip piucca "berry" (GL:64)

	acia aica (1) ("k") "sharp" (AYAK) or "fell, terrible, dire" (PM:347; according to PM:363 seldom applied to evil things). In Aicanáro, q.v.
	acia aica (2) ("k") "broad, vast" (LT2:338 - this early "Qenya" form is probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
aciaf faica ("k") "contemptible, mean" (SPAY)
	acial laica (1) ("k") "keen, piercing" (LT2:337)
	acial laica (2) "green" (but all other sources give laiqua) (Letters:283)
	acialatsaL Lastalaica ("k") "sharp-ears" (name) (LAS2)
	aciam maica ("maika") "sharp, piercing" (SA:maeg), also noun maica ("k") "blade of a cutting tool or weapon, especially sword-blade" (VT39:11)
	aciar  raica ("k") "crooked, bent, wrong" (RÁYAK, VT39:7), pl. raicar in LR:47 (read *raicë in mature Quenya)
	acíl ilca- ("k") "gleam (white)", participle ilcala with pl. allative ending ilcalannar in Markirya (axor ilcalannar "on bones gleaming")
aciom moica ("k") "gentle, soft" (GL:58)
aciop poica ("k") "clean, pure" (POY)
acios soica ("k") "thirsty" (VT39:11)

	acip pica ("k") "small spot, dot" (PIK)
	acla alca ("k") "ray of light" (AKLA-R)
	aclawn nwalca ("k") "cruel" (ÑGWAL; this must represent earlier *ñwalca = *ngwalca; these forms are not given in Etym, but compare nwalmë. In Tengwar writing, the initial NW would be represented by the letter nwalmë.)
	acleh helca ("helka") "icy, icecold" (misprint "helk" in the Etymologies, stem KHELEK; both the Silmarillion Appendix and LT1:254 have helka)
	aclev velca ("k") "flame" (LT1:260; nár, nárë would be the normal word in mature Quenya)
	acleyt tyelca ("k") "swift, agile" (KYELEK), "hasty" (PM:353)
	aclim milca ("k") "greedy" (MIL-IK)
	aclus sulca ("k") "root" (especially as edible) (SÚLUK)
	aclut tulca (1) ("k") "firm, strong, immovable, steadfast" (TULUK). Early "Qenya" also has a verb tulca- ("k") "fix, set up, establish" (LT1:270); this word may still be valid in mature Quenya.
	aclut tulca (2) ("k") "yellow". Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)
	acna anca "jaws, row of teeth" (ÁNAK [there spelt anca], NAK [there spelt anka], Appendix E, SA - despite what Christopher Tolkien says in the entry anca in SA, the Quenya word anca as such does NOT appear in the Sindarin dragon-name Ancalagon, but its Sindarin cognate anc does. See ÁNAK in the Etymologies.) Also name of tengwa 15 (Appendix E). Despite its English gloss, anca is a singular word (in Etym the gloss is indeed "jaw", not "jaws").
	acnam manca- ("k") "trade" (MBAKH)
	acnas sanca (Þ) ("k") "cleft, split" (STAK)
	acnat tanca ("k") "firm, fixed, sure" (TAK)

	acnu unca- ("k") "hollow out" (UNUK)
	acnulut tulunca ("k") "steady, firm" (LT1:270; in mature Quenya tulca)
	acrac carca "tooth" (KARAK) or "fang" (SA:carak-). When referring to a normal tooth, not necessarily sharp, the word nelet is probably to be preferred. Cf. pl. carcar ("karkar") in Markirya, there translated "rocks", evidently referring to sharp rocks. Already the early "Qenya Lexicon" has carca ("k") "fang, tooth, tusk" (LT2:344). Collective carcanë, q.v.
	acral larca ("k") "swift, rapid" (LAK2)
	acrala alarca ("k") swift, rapid" (LAK2)
	acrap parca ("k") "dry" (PÁRAK)

	acsi isca ("k") "pale" (LT1:256)
	acuac cauca ("k") "crooked" (LT1:257; cf. cawin)
	acuaf fauca ("k") "thirsty" (PHAU)
	acual lauca ("k") "warm" (LAW)
	acuan nauca ("k") "stunted" (VT39:7), adjective especially applied to things that though in themselves full-grown were smaller or shorter than their kind, and were hard, twisted or ill-shapen (WJ:413) In early "Qenya", nauca was the noun "dwarf" (LT1:261), but this is in mature Quenya nauco.
	acuara arauca ("k") "swift, rushing" (LT2:347)
	acuel leuca ("k") (2) (probably a misreading for *lenca) "loose, slacken" (LEK)
	acuel leuca (1) "snake" (Appendix E)
	acuit tiuca ("k") "thick, fat" (TIW)
	adl -lda "your" (sg.), possessive suffix attested only in the phrase Arwen vanimalda "Arwen your beauty", sc. "O beautiful Arwen", and in meletyalda "your majesty" (WJ:369) Arwen vanimalda was changed to Arwen vanimelda in the second edition of LotR, so Tolkien may have decided to re-interpret the phrase as *"Arwen, beautiful Elf (Elda)". The ending for "your" appear as -lya elsewhere; -lda may be used in vocatives only. (LotR1:II ch. 6)
	adla alda "tree" (GALAD, GÁLAD, SA, Nam, RGEO:66, LR:41, SD:302, LT1:249, 340, VT39:7), also name of tengwa 28 (Appendix E). Pl. aldar in Narqelion; gen. pl. aldaron "of trees" in Namárië. Etymology of alda, see Letters:426. 
	adlah halda "veiled, hidden, shadowed, shady" (opposed to helda "stripped bare") (SKAL1)
	adlam malda "gold" (as metal - but LotR gives malta, q.v.) (SMAL)
	adlaminav vanimalda *"your beautiful"; Arwen vanimalda "Arwen your beauty = beautiful Arwen" (WJ:369; Tolkien emended vanimalda to vanimelda in the second edition of LotR; see under vanima)
	adlamisíN #Nísimalda pl. Nísimaldar "Flagrant trees", a region in Númenor (UT:167; evidently #nísima "flagrant", attested here only, + aldar "trees"). 
	adlamuluc culumalda a kind of tree (evidently orange-tree, culuma + alda) (SA:mal-)
	adlan nalda "valley" used as an adjective (LT1:261)
	adlaraval lavaralda (changed from lavarin) some kind of tree (alda) (LR:57)
adlav valda "worth, worthy, dear" (GL:23)
adlayteleM  narA Aran Meletyalda "king your mighty" = "your majesty" (WJ:369). 
	adlaytelem meletyalda "your mighty" = "your majesty" (see -lda; #meletya = *"mighty"). In full Aran Meletyalda "king your mighty" (WJ:369)
	adle elda 1. adj. "of the stars", 2. noun (Elda) = one of the people of the Stars, high-elf (SA:êl, elen, ELED, ÉLED; note that Tolkien abandoned a former etymology with "depart"), chiefly in the pl Eldar (WJ:362, cf. GAT(H), TELES). Gen. pl. Eldaron (WJ:368, PM:395, 402); dative pl. eldain "for elves", for Eldar (FS); possessive sg. Eldava "Elf's" (WJ:407); possessive pl. Eldaiva (WJ:368), Eldaivë governing a plural word (WJ:369). The word Eldar properly refers to the non-Avari Elves only, but since Eldar rarely had any contact with the Avari, it could be used for "elves" in general (in LT1:251, Elda is simply glossed "Elf"). 
	adleh helda "naked, stripped bare" (SKEL, SKAL1)
	adlem melda "beloved" (MEL); meldielto "they are beloved" (sc. meld[a]-ië-lto "beloved-are-they" - both the stative verb ending -ië "is/are" and the ending -lto "they" may be obsolete in mature Quenya) (FS)
	adlemassen nessamelda "Nessa-beloved", name of a tree (UT:167)
	adlereP #Perelda pl. Pereldar "Half-elven" (= Sindarin Peredhil) (Letters:282), in the Etymologies used of the Danas or Nandor (PER).
	adles selda (meaning not clear, perhaps the feminine form of seldë "child", hence *"girl") (SEL-D)
	adlet telda (1) "last, final" (WJ:407)
	adlet telda (2) "having a roof" (LT1:268, LT2:348; this "Qenya" word is evidently obsoleted by # 1 above)
	adley [yelda] "friendly, dear as friend" (YEL, struck out)
	adlin nilda "friendly, loving" (NIL/NDIL)
	adlop polda "strong, burly" (POL/POLOD)
	adluc culda ("k") "flame-coloured, golden-red" (KUL)

adna anda "long" (adj.) (ÁNAD/ANDA). 
	adnah handa "understanding, intelligent" (KHAN)
	adnal landa "wide" (LAD)
	adnamagnA Angamanda "Iron-gaol", Sindarin Angband; see Angamando. 
	adnan nanda "water-mead, watered plain" (NAD)
	adnan nanda- ("ñ") "to harp" (ÑGAN/ÑGÁNAD)
	adnap panda "enclosure" (PAD)

	adnef fenda "threshold" (PHEN)

	adnen nenda (1) "watery, wet" (NEN)
	adnep penda "sloping down, inclined" (PEN/PÉNED)
	adnepabma ambapenda "uphill" (adj.) (AM2)
	adnepma ampenda "uphill" (adj.) (AM2)
	adnes senda "resting, at peace" (SED)
	adnif finda "having hair, -haired" (the gloss "-haired" evidently means that finda may be used in compounds, like *carnifinda "red-haired") (PM:340)
	adnil linda "fair, beautiful" (SLIN, LIND)
	adniL Linda pl. Lindar "Singers", what the Teleri called themselves (WJ:380, MR:349, UT:253). It seems that Lindar is also interpreted "the Beautiful" (cf. linda "fair, beautiful"), but this interpretation seems to belong primarily to Tolkien's earlier conception, when Lindar was the name of the First Clan, the later Vanyar (which name similarly means "the Fair"). Adj. Lindarin = Telerin (but Tolkien first held it to be = Vanyarin, since the First Clan, the later Vanyar, were for a while called Lindar – before Tolkien decided to apply this name to the third clan, the Teleri) (TÂ/TA3)
	adnilapac capalinda ("k") "spring of water" (LT1:257; ehtelë is to be preferred in mature Quenya)
	adnilutnil lintulinda, lintulindova *"many-???", *"swift-???" (Narqelion)
	adnim minda "prominent, conspicuous" (MINI)
	adnir rinda "circular" (RIN)
	adnis sinda (Þ) "grey"; nominal pl. Sindar used = "Grey-elves", lit. *"Grey ones"; see WJ:375. Gen. pl. Sindaron in WJ:369. With general meaning "grey" also in Sindacollo > Singollo "Grey-cloak, Thingol" (SA:thin(d); see also sindë, Sindicollo); sindanórië "grey land", ablative sindanóriello "from/out of a grey country" (Nam). However, other sources give sindë (q.v.) as the Quenya word for "grey"; perhaps sinda came to mean primarily "Grey-elf" as a noun. Derived adjective Sindarin "Grey-elven", normally used of the Grey-elven language. (Appendix F)
	adnit tinda (1) "glinting, silver" (adj.) (TIN)
	adnit tinda (2) "spike" (LT1:258; probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
	adniw winda "woof" (LT1:254)
	adnohacnis sincahonda "flint-hearted" (LotR3:VI ch. 6)
	adnorov voronda "steadfast in allegiance, in keeping oath or promise, faithful", used as a title of Elendil Voronda "Elendil the Faithful"; genitive Vorondo in CO. Only glossed "faithful" in LT1:250.
	adnumadna andamunda "elephant" (MBUD)
	adnur runda "rough piece of wood" (RUD)
	adnut tunda- "kindle" (LT1:270; rather tinta- in mature Quenya)
	adnut tunda "tall" (TUN)
	adra arda "realm" (GAR under 3AR); Arda "the Realm", name of the Earth as the kingdom of Arda (Silm). It is said that arda "meant any more or less bounded or defined place, a region" (WJ:402 cf. 413), once translated "Earth" (SD:246). Also name of tengwa 26 (Appendix E). 
	adrah harda (not glossed, evidently a variant of arda "realm") (EN)
	adran narda "knot" (SNAR)
	adranelE Elenarda "Star-kingdom", upper sky (3AR)
adras sarda "hard" (VT39:17); pl. sardë "hards" may be used in the same sense as sarda tengwi, q.v. (As an independent form we would rather expect a nominal pl. sardar.)
adratnE Entarda "Thither Lands, Middle-earth, Outer Lands, East" (seen from Aman) (EN)
adraV Varda "the Sublime", name of a Valië, spouse of Manwë (BARATH, BARÁD, WJ:402; in Letters:282 Varda is translated the "Lofty"), the Queen of the Valar, spouse of Manwë, called Elbereth in Sindarin; genitive Vardo (for *Vardao). (Nam, RGEO:66). Vardamir masc. name, *"Varda-jewel" (Appendix A); vardarianna ?"Varda-gift", name of a tree (but the ri element is obscure) (UT:167)
	adre erda "solitary, deserted" (LT1:269)
	adroc corda ("k") "temple" (LT1:257)
	adrol lorda "drowsy, slumbrous" (LT1:259)
	ae ëa ("eä") "is" (CO), in a more absolute sense ("exists", VT39:7) than the copula ná. Eä "it is" or "let it be", used as a noun for "All Creation", the universe (WJ:402; Letters:284, footnote), but this term for the universe "was not held to include [souls?] and spirits" (VT39:20). Early "Qenya" also has a word ëa "eagle" (LT1:251, LT2:338), but this is certainly obsoleted by soron, sornë in mature Quenya.
	aedla aldëa "tree-shadowed" (LT1:249)
aedlA Aldëa what the Númenóreans called the fourth day of the Eldarin six-day week; see Aldúya.
	aedne #endëa adj. "middle" in atendëa, q.v.
	aednecurip pirucendëa ("k") "whirling lightly" (MC:215; this is "Qenya")
	aedneta atendëa "double-middle", name of the two enderi or middle-days that occurred in leap-years according to the calendar of Imladris (Appendix D, first edition of LotR)

	aelednil lindelëa "melodious" (LT1:258)
	aeliam mailëa "lustful" (MIL-IK)
	aelú úlëa "pouring, flooding, flowing" (ULU)
aemó #ómëa "vowel" (only pl. ómëar attested); this refers to vowels considered as independent phonemes, according to Fëanor's new insights on phonemics. Also #óma-tengwë. (VT39:8)
aemól *lómëa "gloomy" in Lómëanor "Gloomyland"; see Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna...
	aemrum murmëa "slumbrous" (LT1:261)
	aemú úmëa "evil" (UGU/UMU). Is this connected to úmëai in Narqelion, perhaps a "Qenya" plural form?
	aemúlay yalúmëa "olden" (YA)
	aemún númëa "in the West" (actually an adjective *"western", mature Quenya númenya) (LT1:263)
	aemúre erúmëa "outer, outermost" (LT1:262)
	aen nëa an optative form of the verb na- "to be"? (nëa = mature Quenya nai?). ya rato nëa *"which soon may (it) be" = *"which I hope will be soon" (Arct)
aenavú úvanëa "without beauty" (VT39:14)
	aenrodnil lindornëa "having many oak-trees" (adj.) (DÓRON, LI)
	aeráf fárëa "enough"; ufárëa "not enough" (FS). Etym has farëa "enough, sufficient" (PHAR)
	aeráfu ufárëa "not enough" (FS). Cf. ú- "un-" and fárëa "enough, sufficient" (read *úfárëa?)
	aerámla almárëa "blessed" (GALA)
	aeráy yárëa "olden" (YA)
	aerelet telerëa adj. corresponding to Teler (LT1:267; perhaps rather Telerin in mature Quenya)
	aerioc coirëa "living" (glossed "alive" in LT1:257), coirëa quenya "living speech" (PM:399)
	aeró órëa "of the dawn, Eastern" (LT1:264)
aeródloP Poldórëa "Valiant"; as title of Tulkas replaced by Astaldo (POL/POLOD, MR:146, 149); poldórëa is glossed "mighty" in GL:64.
	aeródnil lindórëa ??? (Narqelion)
	aerólo olórëa "dreamy" (LT1:259 - replaced by olosta, UT:396?)

	aesa asëa see asëa aranion
	aessallil lillassëa "having many leaves", pl. lillassië in Markirya (ve tauri lillassië, lit. *"like many-leaved forests", is translated "like leaves of forests" in MC:215)
	aessamiac caimassëa ("k") "bedridden, sick" (KAY)
	aesse essëa ?"primary" (gloss not certainly legible); read probably *yessëa in mature Quenya; see esta. (ESE/ESET)
aessere eressëa "lonely" (ERE, LT1:269). Eressëa "Lonely (One)", often used by itself for Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle (Silm). In early "Qenya", eressë was an adjective or adverb: "singly, only, alone" (LT1:269), but in mature Quenya it is a noun.
	aesserE loT Tol Eressëa "Lonely Isle" (LONO, Silm), also spelt Tol-Eressëa (ERE), Tol-eressëa (TOL2)
	aessuluytnil lintyulussëa "having many poplars" (LI)
aet tëa "indicates" (evidently a present-tense stem) (VT39:6)
aetnalata atalantëa "ruinous, downfallen", pl. atalantië in Markirya (changed to sg. atalantëa - this change does not make sense, since the adjective undoubtedly modifies a plural noun). 
aetonu unotëa, also unotë (read *únotëa, *únotë?) "not counted, uncounted" (VT39:14)
	aeuqninein nieninquëa ("q") adj. "snowdrop-like" (MC:215)
	aev vëa (1) "adult, manly, vigorous" (WEG)
	aev vëa (2) "sea" (MC:213, 214, 216; this is "Qenya" and certainly obsoleted by # 1 above; use ëar in mature Quenya). Inflected vëan "sea" (MC:220), vëar "in sea" (a "Qenya" locative in -r, MC:213), vëassë "on sea" (MC:220). Cf. also vëacirya.

agnafadnA #Andafanga pl. Andafangar "Longbeards", one of the tribes of the Dwarves (= Khuzdul Sigin-tarâg and Sindarin Anfangrim) (PM:320)
	agnar ranga (pl. rangar is attested) "yard, full pace". This Númenórean linar measure was "slightly longer than our yard, approximately 38 inches [= 96.5 cm]". (UT:285, 461)
	agnas sanga (Þ) "crowd, press, throng" (STAG, SA:thang, LT2:342; pl. sangar (?) twice in Narqelion). In Sangahyando (Þ) "Throng-cleaver", name of a man in Gondor (SA:thang; a footnote in Letters:425 explains that "throng" here means a closely formed body of enemy soldiers. In the Etymologies, stems STAG, SYAD, sangahyando is said to be a swordname, and LT2:342 likewise defines the word as a name of Turambar's sword: "cleaver of throngs, Throng-cleaver".
agnav vanga "beard" (LT2:344, GL:21; in mature Quenya fanga)
	agnay yanga- "to yawn" (YAG)

agnil linga- "hang, dangle" (LING/GLING)
	agnir ringa "cold" (Markirya); the Etymologies gives ringë (RINGI), but it seems that ringa is to be preferred. In early "Qenya", ringa is glossed "damp, cold, chilly" (LT1:265) 
agnirif firinga "carcanet, necklace" (LT2:346, GL:36)
	agnit tinga- (not glossed, evidently meaning *"to twang, make a twang") (TING/TANG)

	aiaccE Ekkaia name of the outer ocean: for *et-gaya? (Silm)
	aiaM Maia pl. Maiar "the Beautiful" (MR:49), the lesser (= non-Vala) Ainur that entered Eä. Variant Máyar in PM:363, 364 (is this to be understood as the older form?)

	aiaw waia > vaia "envelope", especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY) (also vaiya, waiya)

	ailacut tucalia ("k") ??? (Narqelion)
	aio oia "everlasting" (OY)
	aiut tuia- "sprout, spring" (Tolkien's gloss is actually "sprouts, springs", since this is also the 3. pers. sg. present tense) (TUY)
	ál lá "no, not" (LA)
	ala ala "after, beyond" (MC:221, 214; mature Quenya has pella "beyond" and evidently #apa "after")
	ala ala- (prefix) "not" (GALA); evidently in Alamanyar
	alac cala ("k") "light" (noun, KAL). Concerning the "Qenya" verb cala-, see cal.
	alacáh hácala ("k") "yawning", a participle occurring in the Markirya poem, derived from an (otherwise unattested) verb #háca- "yawn".

	alal lala- (1) "laugh" (PM:359)
	alal lala- (2) "to deny" (LA)
	alaV Vala "Power, God, angelic power", pl. Valar or Vali (BAL, Appendix E, LT2:348). The Valar are a group of immensely powerful spirits guarding the world on behalf of its Creator; they are sometimes called Gods, though this is strictly wrong according to Christian terminology: the Valar were created. The noun vala is also the name of tengwa 22 (Appendix E). Gen. pl. Valion "of the Valar" (FS); this form shows the pl. Vali, (irregular) alternative to Valar (the gen.pl. could certainly be *Valaron as well). Pl. allative valannar *"to/on the Valar" (LR:47, 56; SD:246). Vala is properly a verb "has power" (sc. over the matter of Eä), also used as a noun "a Power" (WJ:403). The verb vala- "rule, order", used with reference to the Valar only, is attested only in the sentences á vala Manwë! "may Manwë order it!" and Valar valuvar "the will of the Valar will be done" (WJ:404). However, Tolkien did not associate the word Valar with power from the beginning; it apparently meant "the happy ones" in Tolkien's original conception; cf. valto, vald- (LT2:348)

	aliaf faila "fair-minded, just, generous" (PM:352)
	alísis sisíla- is said to be the "frequentative" form of sil- (MC:223); the participle sisílala in Markirya is simply translated "shining".

	allemúf fúmella "poppy" (also fúmellot) (LT1:253)

	allet tella "hindmost, last" (TELES)
	alleze ezella, ezel "green" (in Vanyarin Quenya only). Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)

	alliris sirilla ??? (Narqelion)
	alloc colla "borne, worn" (past participle of col- "bear"); also used as a noun = "vestment, cloak" (MR:385). Variant form collo "cloak" (SA:thin(d) ) in the name Sindicollo (q.v.), sc. colla with a masculine ending.
	allun nulla "dark, dusky, obscure" (NDUL), "secret" (DUL)
	aló óla- "to dream" (said to be "impersonal", probably meaning that the dreamer is mentioned in the dative rather than the nominative) (UT:396)
	alón nóla ("ñ") (1) "wise, learned" (ÑGOL) (note that this and the next nóla would be spelt differently in Tengwar writing, and originally they were also pronounced differently, since nóla "wise, learned" was ñóla in First Age Quenya).
	alón nóla (2) "round head, knoll" (NDOL)
alosto otsola "week" (evidently referring to a week of seven days like our own, since otso = seven). (GL:62)
	alóyh hyóla "trump" (SD:419)
	alumlu ulmula "mumbling" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	alúy yúla "ember, smouldering wood" (YUL)
	ám má "hand" (MA3, LT2:339, Narqelion), dual *mát "a pair of hands" attested with a pronominal suffix: máryat "his/her (pair of) hands" (see -rya, -t) (Nam, RGEO:67), pl. allative mannar "into hands" (FS). Cf. -maitë "-handed".
	ama ama not glossed, evidently meaning "up" like the prefix am- (UNU)

	amállan nalláma, nallama "echo" (LAM)
	amám máma "sheep" (WJ:395)
	amar rama- "to shout" (LT1:259)
	amár ráma "wing", pl. rámar (RAM, Nam, RGEO:66, LT2:335); Markirya has both nominative pl. rámar "wings" and instrumental pl. rámainen *"with wings" (translated "on wings" by Tolkien); rámali "wings" in MC:213 would be a partitive pl. in mature Quenya. Variant rámë in the names Eärrámë, Alquarámë, q.v.

amétocnit tincotéma "t-series", dental series,  first column of the Tengwar system (Appendix E)
	ami -ima adjectival suffix. Sometimes it is used to derive simple adjectives, like vanima "fair" or calima "bright"; it can also take on the meaning "-able", as in úquétima "unspeakable" (from quet- "speak"). Note that the stem-vowel is lengthened in the derivatives where -ima means "-able"). "X-ima" may mean "apt to X", as in Fírimar "mortals", literally "those apt to die" (WJ:387)

	aminav vanima "beautiful, fair" (BAN, VT39:14) (glossed "proper, right, fair" in early "Qenya", LT1:272); nominal pl. vanimar "beautiful ones", partitive pl. genitive vanimálion, translated "of beautiful children", but literally meaning *"of [some] beautiful ones") (LotR3:VI ch. 6, translated in Letters:308).

	amiráynú únyárima "impossible to recount" (because all the facts are not known, or the tale is to long) (WJ:370)
	amirí írima "lovely, beautiful, desirable" (ID, FS), in FS also pl. írimar; in the "Qenya" of Fíriel's Song, adjectives in -a form their plurals in -ar instead of -ë as in mature Quenya.
	amiríf fírima "mortal" (PHIR); Fírima pl. Fírimar "those apt to die", "mortals", an Elvish name of Mortal Men (WJ:387); fírimoin "for men", a dative pl. of Fírimor, "mortals, Men", occurring in Fíriel's Song. Tolkien later changed Fírimor to Fírimar, so the dative would probably be *fírimain in mature Quenya.

	amitsi istima adj. "having knowlegde" (IS)
	amiut tuima "sprout, bud" (noun) (TUY)
	aml #-lma pronominal ending "our", attested (with the genitive ending -o that displaces final -a) in the word omentielmo "of our meeting". This "our" is plural inclusive. Frodo (it seems) improperly used it in the greeting "a star shines on the hour of our meeting": Since he and the Elf he was speaking to constituted only two persons, he should have used the dual inclusive instead. The correct form omentielvo occurs in some of the manuscripts of the Red Book. See Letters:447.
	amla alma "good fortune, weal, wealth" (GALA [ALAM])
	amlac calma "lamp, a light", also name of tengwa 3 (Appendix E, KAL). In early "Qenya", calma ("k") meant "daylight" (LT1:254; in MC:213, the word is translated "light"). Plural instrumental calmainen ("k") "lights-by", by lights (MC:216)

(SA:falas) Falmari "wave-folk", a name of the Teleri (PM:386). -In earlier "Qenya", falma was glossed "foam" (LT1:253, cf. MC:213).

	amlaham mahalma "throne", nominative pl. mahalmar "thrones" and locative pl. mahalmassen in CO. Adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:399)

	amlet telma "a conclusion, anything used to finish off a work or affair", often applied to the last item in a structure, such as a coping-stone, or a topmost pinnacle (WJ:411). In the Etymologies, the word telma seems to mean "base" or "bottom", allative telmanna in the phrase telmello telmanna "from hood to base, from crown to foot, top to bottom". (TEL/TELU)
	amley yelma "loathing" (prob. noun; perhaps a misreading; we would rather expect *yelmë) (DYEL)

	amluy yulma (1) "cup" (Nam, RGEO:67), "drinking-vessel" (WJ:416)

Óma also seems to mean "vowel", cf. the compounds ómataina "vocalic extension", the addition to the base a final vowel identical to the stem-vowel (sundóma) (WJ:371, 417), ómatehtar "vowel-signs", signs used for vowels (usually called simply tehtar, strictly including all kinds of diacritics) (WJ:396)
	amódnus sundóma *"base-vowel" (sundo + óma), the determinant vowel of a "base" or root  (Christopher Tolkien gives the example KAT, which stem has the sundóma A; the stem TALAT has the sundóma repeated; in derivative forms the sundóma might be placed before the first consonant; e.g. ATALAT) (WJ:319)
	amór róma (1) "horn" (WJ:368 - this refers to a "horn" as an instrument rather than as part of an animal; see rassë, tarca)
	amór róma (2) "loud sound, trumpet-sound" (ROM)
	amór róma (3) "shoulder" (LT2:335; evidently obsoleted by # 1 and # 2 above.)

	amrap parma "book", also name of tengwa 2 (PAR, Appendix E). In early "Qenya", the gloss was "skin, bark, parchment, book, writings" (LT2:346), but it seems that in mature Quenya, parma only means "book".

	amullet telluma "dome, copula", especially the "Dome of Varda" over Valinor, but also applied to the domes of the mansion of Manwë and Varda upon Taniquetil. Adopted from Valarin delgûmâ under the influence of pure Quenya telumë (WJ:399, 411). Pl. tellumar is attested (Nam, RGEO:66).
	amuluc culuma ("k") "orange" (fruit not colour) (KUL)

	án ná (1) "is" (Nam, RGEO:67). See also nai.
	án ná (2), also nán, "but, on the contrary, on the other hand" (NDAN; the form nan, q.v., is probably to be preferred to avoid confusion with ná "is").
	an na- a prefix occurring in the Markirya poem, changed to a-, q.v.
	ana ana- (prefix) "to, towards" (NÂ1)
anáf fána (2) "cloud" (SPAN). Cf. fana the "veils" or "raiment" in which the Valar presented themselves to physical eyes, the bodies in which they were self-incarnated, usually in the shape of the bodies of Elves (and Men) (RGEO:74)

	anám mána "blessed" (FS)
	anam mana a word translated "what is" in the sentence mana i-coimas Eldaron[?] "what is the coimas (lembas) of the Eldar?" (PM:395, a variant reading in PM:402) Either it is *ma "what" + ná "is", or mana may itself be a unitary word "what", and there is not really any word meaning "is" in the sentence.
	anaN #Nana pl. Nanar "Green-elves, *Danians" (DAN)
	anáR Rána "the Wayward, the Wanderer", a name of the moon (MR:198, MC:221, Silm); the Etymologies gives Rana with a short vowel (RAN)

	anilam malina "yellow" (SMAL, Letters:308); Malinalda *"Yellow-tree", a name of Laurelin (SA:mal-; evidently malina + alda). The translation "Tree of Gold" in the Silmarillion Index is free; malina means "yellow", not "gold(en)". Cf. malinornélion "of yellow-trees"; see laurelindórenan lindelorendor... (LotR2:III ch. 4; cf. Letters:308). Malinornélion is partitive pl. genitive of malinornë "mallorn" (UT:167, normal pl. malinorni, UT:168).

	atrec certa "rune" (pl. certar given), adapted from Sindarin certh (a "true" or inherited Quenya form of primitive *kirtê would have been *cirtë, but this word did not occur). (WJ:396)
	atro orta- "rise, raise, lift up", pa.t. ortanë (Nam, RGEO:67, ORO; misreading "ortani" in Letters:426)
	atroh horta- "send flying, speed, urge" (KHOR)

	atse esta "first" (ESE/ESET); this entry was marked with a query. The word Yestarë (q.v.) *"Firstday" in LotR suggests that we should read *yesta for esta and also prefix a y to the other words derived from ESE/ESET (essë > *yessë, essëa > *yessëa).
atse esta- "to name" (ES)
	atseh hesta "wither" (LT1:255)

	atsevo [ovesta] "contract, compact, treaty" (WED, WÔ)
	atsewgnet tengwesta "a system or code of signs", "Language", referring particularly to structure, including morphology and grammar (VT39:15). As a technical term for "language", this includes languages not made up of sounds (WJ:394), but usually it means "spoken language" when unqualified (WJ:395). In the Etymologies, tengwesta is glossed "grammar" (TEK).
	atsewh hwesta "breeze, breath, puff of air" (SWES), also name of tengwa 12 (Appendix E); hwesta sindarinwa "Grey-elven hw", name of tengwa 34 (Appendix E). Verb hwesta- "to puff" (SWES)

	atsoh hosta "gather, collect, assemble" (Markirya); hostainiéva "will be gathered", future tense of the stative verb *hostainië, derived from *hostaina "gathered", past participle of hosta- "gather". Such stative verbs are probably not valid in mature Quenya; see -ië. (FS)

	attal latta (2) "strap" (LATH)
	attay yatta "narrow neck, isthmus" (YAK)
	attem metta "end"; Ambar-metta "world-end, the end of the world" (EO); mettarë *"end-day" = New Years' Eve in the Númenórean calendar and the Steward's Reckoning, not belonging to any month (Appendix D)

	attup putta "stop" (in punctuation) (PUT; see PUS)
	atua auta- (1) "go away, leave" (leave the point of the speaker's thought); old "strong" past tense anwë, usually replaced by vánë, perfect avánië - but when the meaning is purely physical "went away (to another place)", the past tense oantë, perfect oantië was used. Past participle vanwa "gone, lost, no longer to be had, vanished, departed, dead, past and over" (WJ:365)
	atua auta- (2) "invent, originate, devise" (GAWA/GOWO) Obsoleted by # 1 above?

	auqla alqua "swan" (ÁLAK [there spelt alqa, as in LT1:249/LT2:335], SA:alqua, UT:265). The alternative form alquë ("q") mentioned in early material (LT1:249) may or may not be valid in mature Quenya. 
	auqli ilqua ("ilqa") "everything" (IL), "all" (FS); ilquainen ("ilqainen") a word occurring in Fíriel's Song, translated "to all". It would appear to be ilqua "all" with a dative pl. ending, but in mature Quenya -inen is the ending for instrumental pl. (FS)
	auqni -inqua adjectival ending, seen in alcarinqua "glorious" (WJ:412) from alcar "glory". Etymologically, -inqua means "-full", like "glory-full" in this case.
auqniracla alcarinqua "radiant, glorious" (AKLA-R [there spelt "alkarinqa"], WJ:412); noun Alcarinquë, "The Glorious", name of a star/planet (SA:aglar - there spelt "Alkarinquë", but the Silmarillion Index has "Alcarinquë". The celestial body in question seems to be Jupiter, MR:435). Cf. also Alcarin, q.v.
	auqnu unqua ("q") "hollow" (adj.) (UNUK)
	auqras sarqua ("q") "fleshy" (LT2:347)

	áv vá (exclamation) "I will not!" or "Do not!"; ván, ványë "I won't!", vammë "we won't" (WJ:371)
	-av -va possessive ending, in Eldaliéva, miruvóreva, Oroméva, Valinóreva. Pl. -vë when governing a plural word (from archaic -vai) (WJ:407), but it seems that -va was used throughout in late Exilic Quenya (cf. miruvóreva governing the plural word yuldar in Namárië). Pl. -iva (-ivë), dual -twa, partitive pl. -líva.
	ava ava (1) "outside" (AWA)
	ava ava- (2) prefix indicating something forbidden: avaquétima "not to be said, that must not be said", avanyárima "not to be told or related" (WJ:370)
	ava ava- (3) (prefix) "without" (AR2, AWA)
	ava ava- (4) pa.t. avanë, a verb that is not clearly glossed; apparently meaning refuse or prohibit (WJ:370). Cf. Avamanyar.
	avá áva, avá (the latter stressed on the final syllable) "Don't!"; ávan "I won't" (also ván, ványë); áva carë! ("k") "don't do it!" (WJ:371)
aván náva ("ñ") "mouth", apparently not only the lips but also the inside of the mouth (VT39:13 cf. 8). Possibly, but probably not, the same element that is translated "hollow" in Návarot, q.v.
aváp páva "mouth" (including tongue, lips and teeth). Apparently changed by Tolkien to náva, q.v. (VT39:19)
	avár ráva (1) "bank" (especially of a river) (RAMBÂ)
	avár ráva (2) "wild, untamed" (RAB)
	avás sáva "juice" (SAB)
	aváy yáva "fruit" (LT1:273; in mature Quenya yávë)
avéiladlE nodniM Mindon Eldaliéva "Lofty Tower of the Eldalië" (Silm)
	avéniuH eruaT Taurë Huinéva "Forest of Shadow", Sindarin Taur na Fuin (PHUY)
	averet tereva "fine, acute" (TER/TERES), "piercing" (LT1:255; glossed "fine, acute" in the Etymologies, but the stem TER is defined as "pierce")
	avéy yéva "will be" (also "there will be"), apparently the future tense of ye. Once translated "is" (írë ilqua yéva nótina, "when all is counted"), but this event belongs to the future; hence literally *"when all will be counted" (FS)
	avi -iva (-ivë) plural possessive ending; seen in Eldaiva, Eldaivë (WJ:369)
	avíl -líva ending for partitive pl. possessive (Plotz); see -li
	avioc coiva ("k") "awake" (LT1:257 - read *cuiva in mature Quenya? Cf. coivië becoming cuivië. On the other hand, the elements cui- and coi- having to do with life and awakening cannot be wholly separated.
	aviuh huiva "murky" (LT1:253)
	avl *-lva pronominal ending, "our", of two persons where one addresses the other (Letters:447). Only attested in the genitive -lvo in the word omentielvo (see -lma). For this reason it has been argued that the ending may actually be *-lwa, since there is some evidence that wo would change to vo in Quenya and the w of *-lwa could be derived from the dual ending -u. (FG)
	avlek #kelva pl. kelvar "animals, living things that move" (Silm)
	avlo #olva pl. olvar "growing things with roots in the earth, *plants" (Silm). More or less the same word as olwa, olba?
	avú úva "will not", future tense of a negative verb (present/aorist tense úyë?) in Fíriel's Song. Cf. also the negative verb u-, um- "not do, not be".
	avu -uva future tense ending. In laituvalmet, tiruvantes, enquantuva, cenuva, caluva.
	avucras sarcuva ("k") "corporeal, bodily" (LT2:347)
	avúl lúva "bow" (Appendix E)
	avulic ciluva ("k") "shall see" (MC:213, 214; this is "Qenya")
	avunac canuva ("k") "leaden" (LT1:268; if this "Qenya" word is used in a mature Quenya context, it must not be confused with the future tense of can-)
	avurú úruva "fiery" (from UR; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it. The word úruva also occurred in early "Qenya"; in LT1:271 it is glossed "like fire".)
	avúrut turúva "wooden" (LT1:270)
	avutnauqne enquantuva "shall refill" (Nam); see en-, quat-
	áw wá (actually spelt wâ) "wind" (LT1:266)
	awgnan nangwa "jaw" (NAK)
	awgnas sangwa "poison" (SAG)
	awgnat tangwa "hasp, clasp" (TAK)

	awgnet tengwa (pl. tengwar attested) "letter", the written representation of a tengwë, q.v. In non-technical usage tengwa was equivalent to "consonant", since only the consonants were full signs (WJ:396, TEK)

	awial laiwa "sick, sickly, ill" (SLIW)
	awias saiwa "hot" (LT1:248, 255, 265)

	awlem melwa "lovely" (LT1:262)
	awley yelwa (1) "loathsome" (DYEL)
	awley yelwa (2) "cold" (LT1:260; this "Qenya" word was certainly obsoleted by # 1 above. Use ringa.)
	awliv [vilwa < wilwa] "air, lower air" (distinct from the 'upper' air of the stars, or the 'outer') (WIL) 
	awliw wilwa "vague, fluttering to and fro" (Markirya). A similar word in the Etymologies was struck out: [wilwa > vilwa] "air, lower air" (distinct from the 'upper' air of the stars, or the 'outer') (WIL)

	awninreiN Nierninwa "Sirius" (a star), also Niellúnë (LT1:262)
	awniradnis sindarinwa (Þ) "Grey-elven" in the phrase hwesta sindarinwa "Grey-elven hw" (Appendix E); it may really be "Sindarin" (as a noun) with the possessive ending -va, -wa appended, hence literally "hw of [the] Sindarin [language]"
	awnirelet telerinwa Telerin (paraphrased "of the Shores of Elfland" in MC:215, since the Teleri dwelt on the shores of the Blessed Realm.) (MC:216)
	awnirodloN Noldorinwa *"Gnomish", Noldorin (LT1:262); lower-case noldorinwa in Narqelion. Would represent earlier *Ñoldorinwa and should be spelt accordingly in Tengwar.
	awnorov voronwa "enduring, long-lasting" (BOR)
	awra arwa "in control of, possessing" (+ genitive), also suffix -arwa (suffix) "having", as in aldarwa "having trees, tree-grown" (3AR)

	awta atwa "double" (AT(AT) )
	awtor rotwa "hollow" (adj? noun?) (also ronta) (LT2:347. In mature Quenya, the preferred words for "hollow" are unqua adj. and unquë noun.)
	axa axa ("ks") (1) "narrow path, ravine" (AK)
	axa axa ("ks") (2) "waterfall" (LT1:249, 255 - this "Qenya" word may have been obsoleted by # 1 above) 
	axam maxa ("ks") "pliant, soft" (MASAG)
	axim mixa ("ks") "wet" (MISK)
	axur #ruxa- "crumble"; verbal stem only attested as a participle ruxal' "crumbling" in the Markirya poem, elided from *ruxala (since the next word begins in an a).
	áy yá "formerly, ago" (YA)
	ay ya relative pronoun "which, what" (attested in the Arctic sentence, and evidently in Narqelion), with locative suffix in Namárië: see *yassë
	ayá áya "awe" (PM:363)
	ayáh háya "far off, far away" (adj.) (KHAYA). Also haiya.

	aydniw windya > vinya "pale blue" (WIN/WIND) (It is uncertain whether Tolkien rejected this word or not; in any case, vinya means "new" in mature Quenya.)
	ayha #ahya- "change", only attested in the past tense: ahyanë (PM:395)
	ayia aiya "hail", as greeting (LotR2:IV ch. 9, see Letters:385 for translation)

	ayiav vaiya < waiya (also vaia, waia) "envelope" (noun), especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY, capitalized Vaiya under GEY; the latter entry was struck out). In a "Qenya" text in MC:214, vaiya is simply translated "sky". 
	ayiaw waiya > vaiya (also vaia, waia) "envelope", especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY)

	aylap palya- "open wide, spread, expand, extend" (PAL)
	aylav valya adj. "having (divine) authority or power" (BAL; this word is of course etymologically connected to the Valar and should not be used with reference to the divinity of Eru.)
	aylawn nwalya- "to pain, torment" (ÑGWAL; this must represent earlier *ñwalya = *ngwalya; these forms are not given in Etym, but compare nwalmë. In Tengwar writing, the initial NW would be represented by the letter nwalmë.)
	aylef felya "cave" (PHÉLEG)
	aylel lelya- "go, proceed (in any direction), travel", pa.t. lendë (WJ:362)
	aylen nelya "third" (cf. neldë "three") in Nelyar "Thirds", the original name of the Noldor (or rather the direct Quenya descendant of the original Primitive Quendian name) (WJ:380).
ayleneM Menelya fifth day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the heavens (Appendix D)
	aylet telya- "finish, wind up, conclude" (transitive) (WJ:411)
	ayli ilya "all" (LR:47, 56; SD:310), "all, the whole" (IL); "each, every, all of a particular group of things" (VT39:20); ilyë before a plural noun, "all" being inflected like an adjective (Nam, RGEO:67): ilyë tier "all paths" (Namárië, VT39:20), ilyë mahalmar "all thrones" (CO)
	aylic cilya "chasm", allative cilyanna ("k") "in-Chasm" (sc. "into [the] chasm") (LR:47, 56). In MR:471, cilya is defined as "cleft, gorge". Spelt kilya in Etym, there defined as "cleft, pass between hills, gorge" (KIL)
	aylicalaC Calacilya ("k") "Pass of Light", in which Kôr was built (KIL, KAL). Evidently a variant of Calacirya.

aylisI Isilya third day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Moon (Appendix D)

	ayliw wilya see vilya
	aylu ulya- "pour", intr. pa.t. ullë, tr. ulyanë (ULU). Cf. ullier "poured", a pl. past tense of ulya- occurring in LR:47; read probably *uller in mature Quenya. In SD:247, ullier is translated "should flow". 
	aymal lamya- "to sound" (LAM)
	aymih himya- "to stick to, cleave to, abide by" (KHIM)
	ayn -nya pronominal suffix, 1. person sg. possessive, "my", e.g. tatanya "my father" (UT:191). This ending seems to prefer i as its connecting vowel where one is needed, cf. Anarinya "my sun" in LR:72, so also in hildinyar.

	aynaf fanya "(white) cloud" (SPAN, FS); pl. fanyar in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67)

	aynamaÚ  #Úamanya pl. Úamanyar "those not of Aman", Elves who did not reach the Blessed Realm (but did leave Cuiviénen with the intention of going there) = Heceldi (WJ:371). Also Úmanyar and fuller Úmaneldi. (WJ:373)

aynep penya "lacking, inadequate"; pl. penyë in penyë tengwi "lacking signs", "inadequate signs"; in early Elvish analysis of Quenya the term for vowels with no preceding consonant, held (in many cases incorrectly) to have lost such a consonant (VT39:6, 8)

	aynereh herenya "fortunate, wealthy, blessed, rich" (KHER)
	ayneuq quenya "speech" (PM:399); the language-name Quenya is said to mean properly "language, speech" (WJ:393). However, Quenya (archaic Quendya, still so in Vanyarin) is also interpreted "Elvish" (Letters:176), sc. the adjective corresponding to Quendi (WJ:374), but it was no longer used as a general adjective. Quenya lambë "Quenya tongue" (WJ:407).

	ayney yenya "last year" (YA)
	ayni inya (1) "female" (INI)

	aynin ninya an element occurring in Fíriel's Song, evidently meaning "my"; see indo-ninya. May not be valid in mature Quenya, that has the ending -nya for "my".

	aynis sinya "new" (SI)
	ayniv vinya (1) "new" (cf. compounds Vinyamar, Vinyarië).
	ayniv vinya (2) < windya "pale blue" (WIN/WIND) (It is uncertain whether Tolkien rejected this word or not; in any case, vinya is only attested with the meaning "new" in mature Quenya.)
	ayniw [winya > vinya (WIN/WIND)]
	ayniwh hwinya- "to swirl, eddy, gyrate" (SWIN)
	ayno onya *"my child", *"my son" (not the normal word for "son", however - it seems to be derived from the stem ONO "beget") (UT:174)

	aynúr rúnya "red flame" (SA:ruin; PM:366 gives runya)

	ayric cirya ("k") "ship" (MC:213, 214, 220, 221), "(sharp-prowed) ship" (SA:kir-, where the word is misspelt círya with a long í; Christopher Tolkien probably confused it with the first element of the Sindarin name Círdan. It seems that Círyon, the name of Isildur's son, is likewise misspelt; read Ciryon as in the index and the main text of the Silmarillion. Cf. also kirya in Etym, stem KIR.) Also in Markirya. In the Plotz letter, cirya is inflected for all cases except plural possessive (*ciryaiva). Locative ciryasse "upon a ship" (MC:216). 
	ayricalaC Calacirya "Light-cleft", Calacirya, the great ravine in the mountains of Valinor, the passage leading from Valmar to the region where the Teleri lived. Genitive Calaciryo in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67)

	ayuam mauya- "compel" (MBAW)
ayúdlA Aldúya fourth day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Trees (Appendix D). The word seems to include *Aldu, a dual form referring to the Two Trees. The Númenóreans altered the name to Aldëa (presumably < *aldajâ), referring to one tree (the White) only.

	car rac- ("k") "break", past participle rácina ("k") "broken" in Markirya

	drav vard- "rule, govern" (LT1:273; hardly valid in mature Quenya)
	e e unidentified word in the sentence e man antaváro? (LR:63), "what will he give indeed?" It may be an adverbial particle "indeed"; on the other hand, one very early "Qenya" text may suggest that it is the pronoun "he", though "he" is also expressed as the ending -ro: *"He - what will he give?" A word e "he" also occurs in the Sindarin text of the King's Letter (SD:128-9)
	eA Ae (Quenya?) "day" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK - ae was written over ar [# 2] in the names of the Valinorean week, but ar was not struck out.)

(In early "Qenya", lambë was defined as "tongue" of body, but also of land, or even = "speech" [LT2:339]. In mature Quenya lambë ONLY means "tongue = speech", while the word for a physical tongue is lamba.) Lambë Valarinwa "Valarin tongue" (WJ:397); Lambengolmor "Loremasters of Tongues", a school founded by Fëanor (WJ:396)

	ebmut tumbë "trumpet" (LT1:269)
	ecial laicë ("k") "keen, sharp, acute" (LAIK - this may very well be a misreading for laica, which would make this word the same as laica # 1)
	ecian naicë ("k") "sharp pain" (NÁYAK)
	ecilev velicë ("k") "great" (LT1:254; probably not valid in mature Quenya; in the context of the Etymologies it would have to be derived from BEL, but it is stated that this stem was "not found in Q". Perhaps Tolkien rejected velicë because it was too similar to the Russian word that clearly inspired it.)

	ecniric #cirincë pl. cirinci ("k"), a species of birds, "no bigger than wrens, but all scarlet, with piping voices on the edge of human hearing" (UT:169). Seems to incorporate the diminutive ending -incë.

	edleyt tyeldë "end" (noun), also short form tyel (KYEL)
	edlic cildë ("k") "saw" (???) The phrase úri kilde hísen níe nienaite is translated "the Sun with wet eyes dropped tears of mist", literally perhaps something like *"the Sun saw (through) misty tears tearfully"??? (MC:221; this is "Qenya"; cf. cildo)
	edlih #hildë pl. hildi, -hildi "followers" (used = mortal men) (KHIL) (also Hildor, q.v.). Dat. pl. hildin "for men", a dative pl. occurring in Fíriel's Song. Cf. hildinyar "my heirs", evidently *hildë, hildo "follower, heir" + -inya "my" + -r plural ending (EO) 
	edlin nildë "friend" (fem.) (NIL/NDIL)
	edlirI Irildë "Idhril" (Idril) (LT2:343); Irildë Taltelemna = (mature) Sindarin Idril Celebrindal; replaced Irildë Taltelepsa (KYELEP/TELEP). Tolkien may have replaced Irildë as the Quenya form of Idril with Itaril, Itarillë, Itarildë, q.v.

ednam mandë "doom, final end, fate, fortune" (usually = final bliss) (MANAD, under MAN)
	ednan nandë (1) "valley" in Laurenandë (UT:253); also nan, nand- "valley" (Letters:308); Nan-Tasarion "Vale of Willows" (LotR2:III ch. 4) (Note that this and the next nandë would be spelt differently in Tengwar writing, and originally they were also pronounced differently, since nandë "harp" was ñandë in First Age Quenya).

	ednel lendë "left, went" (pa.t. of lelya- "go") (FS, LR:47, SD:310, WJ:362), or, according to the Etymologies, the pa.t. of linna- "go" and lesta- "leave" (LED, ELED)

	ei -ië (1) infinitive (or gerundial) ending, attested in enyalië, q.v. (CO)

Compare ye "is", yéva "will be", verbs that also occur in Fíriel's Song. This suffix is probably not valid in mature Quenya: -ië is an infinitival or gerundial ending in CO, for ye "is" we here find ná, and the phrase "lost is" is vanwa ná, not *vanwië.
	eil lië "people" (LI, Narqelion), in Eldalië (q.v.); possessive #liéva in Mindon Eldaliéva (q.v.)
eiladlE Eldalië "the Elven-folk" (often used vaguely to mean all the race of Elves, though it properly did not include the Avari) (WJ:374, ÉLED; possessive Eldaliéva in the name Mindon Eldaliéva, q.v.)

	enóllavA Avallónë Haven and city on Tol Eressëa. In the Akallabêth the city is said to be so named because it is "of all cities the nearest to Valinor", but the etymology is not further explained. The Etymologies gives Avalóna "the outer isle" = Tol Eressea (LONO, (AWA) )

	ép pé "lip", dual peu "the two lips, the mouth-opening" (VT39:9). In an earlier source, the Etymologies, pé was glossed "mouth" (PEG)
	eplet telpë "silver", telep- in some compounds like Teleporno; assimilated telem- in Telemnar (KYELEP/TELEP, SA:celeb, LT1:255, 268; also tyelpë, telep-, UT:266). The true Quenya descendant of primitive *kyelepê is tyelpë, but the Telerin form telpë was more common, "for the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor" (UT:266). Telperion the White Tree of Valinor; Telperien ("Telperiën"), fem. name including telp- "silver" (Appendix A); Telperinquar "Silver-fist, Celebrimbor" (SA:celeb - also Tyelperinquar); Telporno, Teleporno "Silver-high" = Sindarin Celeborn (Letters:347, UT:266). It seems that Teleporno is properly Telerin, Quenyarized as Telporno.
	epleyt tyelpë "silver" (KYELEP/TELEP), etymology also in Letters:426 and UT:266. Tyelpë is the true Quenya descendant of primitive *kyelepê, but the Telerin form telpë was more common, "for the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor" (UT:266).

	ér ré "day" (of the sun) (Appendix D); short -rë in compounds like Ringarë
	erá árë "day" (PM:127) or "sunlight" (SA:arien). Also name of tengwa 31; cf. also ar # 2. Originally pronounced ázë; when /z/ merged with /r/, the letter became superfluous and was given the new value ss, hence it was re-named essë (Appendix E). Also árë nuquerna *"árë reversed", name of tengwa 32, similar to normal árë but turned upside down (Appendix E). –In the Etymologies, this word has a short vowel: arë pl. ari (AR1)
eradlon noldarë "mole"; also nolpa (GL:30)
	eráf fárë "sufficiency, plenitude, all that is wanted" (PHAR)
	eragniR Ringarë the twelfth and last month of the year, "December" (Appendix D, SA:ring); the word seems to mean "Cold-day".

	eramla almarë "blessedness, 'blessings', good fortune, bliss" (GALA)
	eramlI Ilmarë "starlight", also name of a Maia (GIL, SA:ilm-)
	erán nárë, also short nár, "flame" (NAR1, Narqelion). Translated "fire" in some names, see Aicanáro, Fëanáro (where nár apparently has the masculine ending -o)
	erasat tasarë, tasar "willow-tree" (TATHAR). In Tasarinan *"Willow-valley", Nan-tasarion *"Valley of willows" (SA:tathar)
	erát tárë "in that day", not translated in its first occurrence in Fíriel's Song
	eratno ontarë "begetter, parent" (fem); pl. ontari (see ontani) covers both sexes. (ONO)
	eratsey yestarë *"first-day", the first day of the year (loa), immediately before tuilë  (Appendix D)
	eráuq quárë (also quár) "fist" (SA:celeb, KWAR; in the Etymologies, Tolkien first wrote quár pl. quari, and quár is also found in PM:318. As usual, the Etym forms have q instead of qu.) According to PM:318, the "chief use [of this word] was in reference to the tightly closed hand as in using an implement or a craft-tool rather than to the 'fist' as used in punching".
	eráy yárë "former days" (YA)
	eraynaf fanyarë "the skies" (not heaven or firmament - the upper airs and clouds). Note that despite its English gloss, fanyarë is a singular word and therefore takes a singular adjective/participle, as in fanyarë rúcina "ruined skies" in Markirya (see MC:220, note 8 for this translation)
	eráyne enyárë "in that day" (pointing to the future) (FS)
	eráynemul lumenyárë "history, chronological account" (NAR2 - read *lúmenyárë?)
	ere erë, eren "iron" or "steel"; Eremandu variant of Angamandu (Angband) (LT1:252; "iron" should be anga in mature Quenya, but these words may be used for "steel")
	eredne #enderë pl. enderi "middle-days", in the calendar of Imladris three days inserted between the months (or seasons) yávië and quellë (Appendix D)
	eréh hérë "lordship" (LT1:272)
	eréillac calliérë "shone" ("k") (MC:220; this is "Qenya" - mature Quenya *callë, *caltanë.)
	eréliut tuilérë *"Spring-day", a day outside the months in the Steward's Reckoning, inserted between Súlimë and Víressë (March and April). In early "Qenya", Tuilérë was simply glossed "Spring" (LT1:269).
	erés sérë "rest, repose, peace" (SED); see under úyë concerning the sentence úyë sérë indo-ninya símen in Fíriel's Song
	eret terë, ter "through" (Notes on CO, UT:317, TER/TERES, Narqelion)
	erév vérë "bond, troth, compact, oath" (WED)
eréyn nyérë "grief" (LT1:261), "sorrow" (GL:60)

	erí írë (1) "desire" (ID)
erí írë (2) "when" (relative, not question-word: írë Anarinya queluva, "when my sun faileth") (FS)
	eria [airë (3) "eternity" (EY)]
	eria airë (1) "holy", airetári or Airë Tári "holy queen" (a title of Varda, PM:363), genitive aire-tário "holy-queen's" (Nam, RGEO:67 - but according to PM:363, airë is the noun "sanctity", while aira is the adjective "holy")
	eria airë (2) "sea" (dat.sg. airen given) (AYAR/AIR)
	eriac cairë ("k") "lay" (pa.t. of "lie") (MC:221; this is "Qenya" - in mature Quenya *caitanë pa.t. of caita?)
eriaf fairë (1) "phantom, disembodied spirit, when seen as a pale shape" (pl. fairi in Markirya); also used = "spirit (in general)" (MR:349)
	eriaf fairë (2) "natural death" (as act) (PHIR)
eriaf fairë (3) "radiance" (PHAY)
eriaf fairë (4) "free" (LT1:250) (use rather mirima in mature Quenya)
	erial lairë (1) "summer" (Letters:283), in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 72 days, but also used without any exact definition (Appendix D). Oiolairë "Eversummer"; see Coron Oiolairë. Lairelossë *"Summer-snow", name of a tree (UT:167), perhaps with white flowers.
	erial lairë (2) "poem" (GLIR) 
	erial lairë (3) "meadow" (LT1:267, GL:39  - perhaps a doubtful word in mature Quenya, since lairë already has to carry two other meanings)
	erialeteM Metelairë alternative name of August (PM:135)
	eriallE Ellairë alternative name of June (PM:135); evidently incorporating lairë "summer"; the el- part is probably an assimilated form of er-, an element meaning one or first, June being the first summer month.
	erialloroC Corollairë ("Korollairë") see Coron Oiolairë
	erialóN Nólairë alternative name of July (PM:135)
	erian nairë "lament" (noun) (NAY)
eriapa apairë "victory" (GL:17)
	eriatalA Alatairë "Great Sea", name of Western Ocean between Beleriand and Valinor, called Belegaer in Sindarin (ÁLAT, AYAR/AIR)
	eriaV Vairë "the Weaver", name of a Valië, spouse of Mandos (Silm, WEY). The name is translated "Ever-weaving" in VT39:10, and it is implied that the archaic form was *Wairê rather than Weirê, the reconstruction given in the Etymologies (LR:398).
	erif firë pl. firi "mortal man" (PHIR) ("Firi" is not clearly glossed and may also be an archaic form from which firë is derived, since word-final short *i became e in Quenya - but since we would rather expect the spelling *phiri if it were an archaic form, it is best taken as the pl. of firë.)
	eríl lírë "song", instrumental lírinen "in [the] song" or *"by [the] song" (Nam, RGEO:67)
	erím mírë "jewel" (MIR, SA:mîr). Cf. Elemmírë; short form -mir in Tar-Atanamir. (SA:mîr)

 erímannavay yavannamírë "Yavanna-jewel", name of a tree with globed and scarlet fruits (UT:167)
	erímmelE Elemmírë *"Star-jewel" (elen + míre, note assimilation nm > mm), name of a star/planet (possibly Mercury, MR:435, where the spelling is Elemmirë); also name of an Elf. (SA:mîr)
	erímodloN Noldomírë lit. *"Noldo-jewel", another word for Silmaril (ÑGOLOD). Would represent earlier *Ñoldomírë and should be spelt accordingly in Tengwar.
	erímulI Ilumírë *"World-jewel", another word for Silmaril (IL)
	erín nírë "tear" (NEI)
	erio oirë "everlasting [?age]" (Reading of gloss uncertain) (OY)
	erioc coirë "stirring", in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 54 days (Appendix D), but translated "the first day of Spring" in the Silmarillion Appendix (SA:cuivië). Early "Qenya" has coirë ("k") "life" (LT1:257; in later Quenya, the word for "life" is cuilë; however, cf. the adj. coirëa "living" occurring both in an early and a late source).
	eriocóN Nócoirë alternative name of March (PM:135)
	eriocrE Ercoirë alternative name of February (PM:135)
	erion #noirë "tomb", isolated from Noirinan, q.v.
	erís sírë "river" (SIR), "stream" (LT1:265)
	eró órë (1) "heart" (inner mind), also name of tengwa 21. (Appendix E) Cf. the description of Galadriel in PM:337, that "there dwelt in her the noble and generous spirit (órë) of the Vanyar".
	eró órë (2) "rising" (ORO), cf. early "Qenya" órë "the dawn, Sunrise, East" (LT1:264)
	erodlop poldorë (not glossed, derived from polda "strong, burly") (POL/POLOD)
	eródnA Andórë full form of Andor, "land of gift", name of Númenor (SD:247)
	eróh hórë "impulse" (KHOR), hórëa "impulsion" (KHOR) (should probably mean *"impulsive" instead - Christopher Tolkien may have misread the gloss)
	eról lórë "slumber" (LOS)
	erom morë "black" (MOR), "dark, darkness" (Letters:282)
	eróm mórë "blackness, dark, night, darkness" (MOR, MC:214), also given with short vowel: morë "dark, darkness" (Letters:282)
	erón nórë "land" (associated with a particular people) (WJ:413), "country, land, dwelling-place, region where certain people live, race, clan" (NÔ, NDOR, BAL), also used = "people" (SA:dôr; however, the normal word for "people" is lië). Early "Qenya" has nórë "native land, nation, family, country" (in compounds -nor) (LT1:272) 
	erónanrA Arnanórë, Arnanor "Arnor", Royal Land (so #arna = "royal"?) (Letters:428)
	erónatseL Lestanórë "Doriath", gen. Lestanórëo (WJ:369)
eróno onórë "sister" (of blood-kin) (THEL/THELES, NÔ; both of these entries in the Etymologies as reproduced in LR have the reading "onóne", but the "Old Noldorin" cognate wanûre listed in the entry THEL/THELES seems to indicate that the Quenya word should be onórë; the letters n and r are easily confused in Tolkien's handwriting. There is no clear evidence for a feminine ending -në in Quenya, while -rë is relatively well attested; cf. for instance ontarë = female parent, mother.)
	erónemúN Númen(n)órë "people of the west", confused with Númendor "land of the west" (SA:dôr); hence Númenor as the name of the great isle given to the Edain by the Valar (FS, LR:56); full form Númenórë (LR:47, SD:247, NDÛ); allative númenórenna "to Númenor" (LR:56)
	eronewiA Aiwenorë (read *Aiwenórë?), Aiwenor "Birdland" = lower air (AIWÊ) 
	erónilaV Valinórë (BAL, NDOR), usually shortened Valinor, "the land (or people) of the Valar", *"Vali-land" (Vali = Valar), land of the Gods in the West (BAL, NDOR); cf. Valandor. In the early "Qenya Lexicon", Valinor, Valinórë is glossed "Asgard", the name of the city of the gods in Norse mythology (LT1:272). Possessive (here object genitive) Valinóreva in Nurtalë Valinóreva, the "Hiding of Valinor" (Silm).
	erop porë "flour, meal" (POL/POLOD)
	erórana anarórë "sunrise" (ORO)
	erouH Huorë "Heart-vigour" (masc. name) (KHÔ-N)
eróvurim miruvórë "meed", "a special wine or cordial". Also short miruvor. Possessive miruvóreva "of meed" (Nam, RGEO:66; WJ:399) In the "Qenya Lexicon", miruvórë was defined "nectar, drink of the Valar" (LT1:261).
	erú úrë "heat", also name of tengwa 36 (Appendix E)
	erua aurë "sunlight, day" (SA:ur), locative auressë "in (the) morning" in Markirya
	eruac caurë ("k") "fear" (LT1:257)
	erual laurë "gold", but of golden light and colour, not of the metal. In Etym defined as "light of the golden Tree Laurelin, gold" - but not properly used of the metal gold (LÁWAR/GLÁWAR, GLAW(-R) ). In early "Qenya", however, laurë was defined as "(the mystic name of) gold" (LT1:255, 258) or simply "gold" (LT1:248, 268). 
	erualacaM Macalaurë ("Makalaurë"), masc. name, the mother-name (never used in narrative) of Canafinwë = Maglor (PM:353, MAK); his Sindarin name is seen to be based on his mother-name. In the Etymologies, Macalaurë is interpreted "Gold-cleaver" (MAK)
	erualodnU Undolaurë "Glorund" (> Glaurung). Also Laurundo. (LT2:341)
	eruam maurë "need" (MBAS)
	eruat taurë "(great) wood, forest" (SA:taur, Letters:308, TÁWAR), pl. tauri in Markirya
	erúl lúrë "dark weather" (LT1:259)
	erúlap palúrë "surface, bosom, bosom of Earth" (= Old English folde) (PAL); cf. Palúrien.
	erúmoiO Oiomúrë place-name; *"Ever-?mist" (Silm)
	erús súrë "wind", instrumental súrinen "in the wind" or more literally *"by the wind" (Nam, RGEO:66, Markirya); Súrion masc.name, *"Wind-son" (Appendix A). Early "Qenya" has súru (MC:213, 216, 220)
	erút túrë "mastery, victory" (TUR)
	erutsut tusturë "tinder" (LT1:270)
esáf fásë "gap, gulf" (GL:36)
	esén nésë (Þ) "youth", also nessë (NETH)
	esíh hísë (1) "mist, fog" (KHIS/KHITH). Earlier "Qenya" words, probably obsoleted by this word: (2) "dusk" (LT1:255), (3) "blinking" (?) (MC:214)
	esipmis simpisë "piping" (LT1:266)
	espal lapsë "babe" (LAP)
espel lepsë "finger" (LEP/LEPET)
	esput tupsë "thatch" (TUP)
	ess -ssë locative ending; in Lóriendessë, q.v.; pl. -ssen in yassen, mahalmassen, q.v. The endings for part. pl. (-lissë or -lissen) and dual (-tsë) are only known from the Plotz letter.
	essacia aicassë ("k") (1) "mountain peak" (AYAK)
essacia aicassë ("k") (2) "pinetree" (GL:17; this "Qenya" word is evidently obsoleted by # 1 above.)
	essacrac carcassë, carcaras ("k") "row of spikes or teeth" (LT2:344 - mature Quenya has carcanë, but these words, especially carcassë, may still be valid)
	essacre ercassë ("k") "holly" (ERÉK)
	essadnah handassë "intelligence" (KHAN)
	essaev vëassë "vigour" (WEG)
	essaf fassë "tangled hair, shaggy lock" (PHAS)
	essal lassë "leaf", pl. lassi (Nam, RGEO:66, Letters:283, LAS1, LT1:254, VT39:9, Narqelion); gen. lassëo "of a leaf", gen. pl. lassion "of leaves" (earlier lassio) (WJ:407); lasselanta "leaf-fall", used (as was quellë) for the latter part of autumn and the beginning of winter (Appendix D, Letters:428); hence Lasselanta alternative name of October (PM:135).
	essala alassë "joy, merriment" (GALÁS)
essalac calassë ("k") "clarity, brilliance" (GL:39)
	essalaf falassë, also short falas (falass-), "shore, beach" (LT1:253, LT2:339); falassë "shore, line of surf" (SA:falas), "beach" (PHAL/PHÁLAS); Falassë Númëa "Western Surf" (LT1:253)
	essalav valassë "divinity" (or rather *"valahood"; the word should probably not be used with reference to the divinity of Eru). (BAL)
	essaleuqinat taniquelassë name of tree (UT:167), perhaps Tanique(til) + lassë "leaf"
essaluaqiaL Laiqualassë ("q") "Legolas" (Greanleaf) (LT1:267)

	essar rassë "horn" (especially on living animal, but also applied to mountains) (RAS, PM:69)
	essarat tarassë ??? (Narqelion)
	essaraynafrA Arfanyarassë, Arfanyaras (*Arfanyarass-) a "variant or close equivalent" of Taniquetil (WJ:403)

	essatnail liantassë "vine" (LT1:271)
	essauqial laiquassë ("q") "greenness" (LT1:267)
	essay #yassë (1) "in which", pl. yassen referring back to a plural noun. (Nam, RGEO:66) 
	essay yassë (2) "once upon a time" (YA); writers should rather use yalúmessë or yáressë of similar meaning to avoid confusion with # 1 above.
	essayagna angayassë "misery" (LT1:249)
	esse essë (1) "name", also later name of tengwa 31, originally called árë (ázë). (Appendix E). Pl. essi in PM:339 and MR:470. 
esse essë (2) "beginning" (ESE/ESET). This entry was marked by a query in Etym, and a word in the appendices to LotR suggests that it was emended to YESE/YESET; we should therefore read *yessë for essë.
	essednif findessë "a head of hair, a person's hair as a whole" (PM:345)
	esselem melessë, meles "love" (LT1:262; rather melmë in mature Quenya)

	essemlic #cilmessë pl. cilmessi "selv-names", literally names of personal choice (PM:339) (cilmë + essi, hence *"choice-names").

	ew -wë a suffix occurring in many personal names, generally but not exclusively masculine; derived from a stem simply meaning "person" (PM:340, WJ:399).

In the Etymologies, tengwë is glossed "writing" (TEK), but a later source provides the word sarmë for this meaning. hloníti tengwi "phonetic signs" (WJ:395); #mussë tengwë phrase only attested in the pl.: mussë tengwi ("ñ") "soft elements", a term for vowels, semi-vowels (y, w)  and continuants (l, r, m, n).

	eynas sanyë (Þ) "rule, law" (STAN)
	eynecapa apacenyë is translated "foresight" in MR:216; yet the context and the form of the word itself clearly indicates that it is actually the pl. form of an adjective *apacenya "of foresight". The noun "foresight" is almost certainly *apacen; cf. tercen "insight". (MR:216) The literal meaning of *apacen is *"aftersight", sc. knowledge of that which comes after.

Note that before a verb, i means "the one who", or, in the case of a plural verb, "those who"; cf. also i carir quettar ómainen "those who form words with voices" (WJ:391). 
	i -i nominative plural ending regularly used on nouns ending in a consonant and in -ë (except as a part of -ië); in the latter case, -ë is displaced (Quendë pl. Quendi).
	ia ai! interjection  "Ah!", "Alas!" (Nam, RGEO:66; also twice in Narqelion, untranslated.)
	iadlis sildai ??? (Narqelion)
	ian nai (1) "be it that", used with a future tense-verb to express a wish. The translation "maybe" in Tolkien's rendering of Namárië is somewhat misleading; he used "be it that" in the interlinear translation in RGEO:67. Nai hiruvalyë Valimar! Nai elyë hiruva! *"May thou find Valimar. May even thou find it!" (Nam). Nai tiruvantes "be it that they will guard it" > "may they guard it" (CO)
	ian nai (2) "alas" (NAY; may be obsoleted by # 1 above - in mature Quenya, ai is to be preferred)
	ianilam malinai ??? (Narqelion)
	iarabmaenrac carneambarai ("k") "red-???" (Narqelion; very early "Qenya")
	iavuluc culuvai ("k") ??? (Narqelion)

	idnama amandi pl. of óman, q.v. (amandi is evidently a misreading for *omandi) (OM)
idnamagnA Angamandi see Angamando (LT1:249)
	idneuQ Quendi "Elves" as a race (analogical sg. quendë, not much used) (WJ:361; SA:quen-/quet-, WJ:372, KWEN(ED), spelt "qende, Qendi" in Etym). Gen. pl. Quendion (PM:395)
	idneuq quendi "Elvish woman", pl. quendir given (MR:229; changed from quendë pl. quender); the sg. quendi must not be confused with the pl. Quendi, see above.
	idni indi - apparently a name of Men, hardly valid in mature Quenya (LT2:343)
	idniL Lindi What the Green-elves (Laiquendi, Nandor) called themselves; also used in Exilic Quenya (WJ:385)
	idnis sindi "river" (LT1:265; rather sírë in mature Quenya)
	idnisulec celusindi ("k") "a river" (LT1:257; hardly a valid word in mature Quenya - use sírë)
	idniuqraS Sarquindi ("q") "Cannibal-ogres" (LT2:347)
	igniuq quingi ("q") "twang, of strings, harp" (LT1:256; rather tingë, tango in mature Quenya)
	il -li partitive pl. ending (simply called a plural suffix in the Etymologies, stem LI); genitive -lion in vanimálion, allative -linna and -linnar in falmalinnar, q.v. The other cases are only known from the Plotz letter: possessive -líva, dative -lin, locative -lissë or -lissen, ablative -lillo or -lillon, instrumental -línen, "respective" -lis.
	illes selli (Þ) pl. of seler (THEL/THELES)
	im mi "in, within" (MI); mí "in the" (Nam, RGEO:66; CO gives mi; the correct forms should evidenly be mi = "in" and mí = mi i "in the"). Allative minna "to the inside, into" (MI).
	imec cemi "earth, soil, land"; Cémi ("k") "Mother Earth" (LT1:257; the "Qenya" word cemi surely corresponds to cemen in mature Quenya)
	imól lómi "clouds" (MC:214; this is "Qenya")

	inuruc curuni ("k") "witch" (of the good magic) (LT1:269)
	io oi "ever" (OY)
	ioem mëoi "cat", a somewhat strange word by mature Quenya standards (no other cases of final -oi in the singular). Vardo Meoita "Prince of Cats"; meiota seems to be a kind of adjective rather than a genitive (LT2:348). 
	ion noi "lament" (NAY)
	iot toi "they" (FS; replaced by te in mature Quenya?)
	iramíuq químari ("q") "phantoms" (MC:213; in mature Quenya fairi, sg. fairë)

iróleP Pelóri "Fencing Heights", the mountains raised by the Valar to protect Aman (SA:pel, WJ:403)

	ís sí "now" (Nam, RGEO:67, LR:47, 310), sin (SI, LR:47) or sín (SD:247, 310) before vowels. Compare the distribution of a/an in English. In Fíriel's Song, sí is translated "here".

	iuqnil linqui ("q") "wet" (MC:216; mature Quenya has linquë.)

	ivurehemún númeheruvi "Lords-of-West" (*"West-lords") in SD:246

ixay yaxi "cow" (in mature Quenya, this looks rather like a plural); cf. yaxë "milch cow" (GL:36)
	l -l reduced pronominal affix of the 2. person, "you" (pl.). See heca! (WJ:364)
	la 'al- "thrive" (GALA; the ' simply indicates that the original initial G has disappeared and need not normally be included.)
	labma ambal "shaped stone, flag" (MBAL)

	lát tál (tal-, as in "g.sg. talen", in mature Quenya dat.sg.) "foot" (TAL). Early "Qenya" forms: tala "foot" (LT2:347) and dual talwi "the feet" (LT2:347); tálin "feet" (MC:216); instrumental talainen, talalínen "with wings, on wings" (wings here meaning sails) (MC:213, 216, 220; this is "Qenya")

	leceH Hecel ("k") (Heceld-, e.g. pl. Heceldi, WJ:371) = hecil, q.v., but reformed to match Oarel, especially applied to the Eldar left in Beleriand. Helcelmar and Heceldamar *"Land of Forsaken Elves", the name used by the loremasters of Aman for Beleriand. (WJ:365)

	lei -iel patronymic (or matronymic) ending -"daughter" (YEL) (In the Etymologies, Tolkien struck out this ending and the corresponding independent word yeldë "daughter", changing them to -ien, yendë. However, the ending -iel later turns up in the name Uinéniel "Daughter of Uinen" in UT:182, so it would seem that Tolkien changed his mind again and restored this ending, and perhaps the noun yeldë along with it.)
	leir riel (*riell-) "garlanded maiden" (SA:kal-), full form riellë "a maiden crowned with a festival garland" (PM:347). In Altariel, Altariellë.

	leiríM Míriel *"Jewel-woman" (Silm), genitive Míriello (see namna)

lidleneM Meneldil *"Heaven-friend" = astronomer (Appendix A; Letters:386)
	lidn -ndil (also -dil) ending in many names, like Amandil, Eärendil; it implies devotion or disinterested love and may be translated "friend" (SA:(n)dil); this ending is "describing the attitude of one to a person, thing, course or occupation to which one is devoted for its own sake" (Letters:386)
	lidn -ndil, -dil = Old English "-wine", sc. "-friend" in names, e.g. Elendil, Eärendil (NIL/NDIL)

	lidnelE Elendil masc. name "Star-friend", "Lover or student of stars", applied to those devoted to astronomical lore. However, when the Edain used this name they intended it to mean "Elf-friend", confusing elen "star" and elda "elf" (WJ:410). (This idea that the name was misapplied seems to be late; Tolken earlier interpreted the name as an ancient compound Eled + ndil; see Letters:386. See also NIL/NDIL in the Etymologies, where Elendil is equated with "Ælfwine", Elf-friend).

lidranA Anardil masc. name, *"Sun-friend", (Appendix A). 
	lidraniM Minardil masc.name *"minar[?]-friend". Perhaps minar is to be understood as a variant of minas (s being voiced to z by contact with the voiced plosive that follows, and then regularly becoming r); if so, the name means *"Tower-friend" (Appendix A)
	ligniR Ringil name of one of the great Lamps (pillared on ice), apparently contains ringë (RINGI)
	ligniw wingil (wingild-, as in pl. Wingildi) "nymph" (WIG, LT1:273); "Qenya" pl. wingildin "foam-fays, foam-maidens" (MC:216)

	liratI Itaril (*Itarill-), Itarillë, Itarildë fem. name, Sindarized as Idril (PM:346, 348; SA:ril). (In earlier sources, Tolkien used Irildë as the Quenya form of Idril.)

	liteuqin niquetil ("q") "snowcap" (LT1:266)
	liteuqinaT Taniquetil (Taniquetild-) the highest of the mountains of Valinor, upon which were the mansions of Manwë and Varda; properly, this name refers to the topmost peak only, the whole mountain being called Oiolossë (SA:til). The Etymologies has Taniquetil, Taniquetildë ("q") (Ta-niqe-til) ("g.sg." Taniquetilden, in mature Q dat.sg.) "High White Horn" (NIK-W, TIL, TA/TA3, OY)
	litlen neltil (neltild-, as in pl. neltildi) "triangle" (TIL, NEL)
litniw wintil "a glint" (LT1:261)

	liw wil- "fly" (1. pers. aorist wilin "I fly"; changed from vilin pa.t. villë; new past tense presumably *willë) (WIL). The early "Qenya" lexicon has wili- "sail, float, fly" (LT1:273)

	lóm mól "slave, thrall" (MÔ)
	lot tol "island, isle" (rising with sheer sides from the sea or from the river, SA:tol). In early "Qenya", the word was defined as "island, any rise standing alone in water, plain of green, etc" (LT1:269). The stem is toll-; the Etymologies as published in LR gives the pl. tollë (TOL2), probably a misreading for tolli, as in LT1:85.
	ludnereT Terendul "Slender-(and)-dark", masc. name (LR:59, TER/TERES, DUL, NDUL)
	lut tul- "come", 1. pers. aorist tulin "I come" (TUL), perfect utúlië "has come" (utúlien "I am come", EO), utúlie'n aurë "Day has come" (the function of the 'n is unclear; it may simply be inserted for euphony). Past tense túlë "came" in LR:47 and SD:246; read perhaps *tullë in mature Quenya. Cf. early "Qenya" perfects tulielto "they have come" (LT1:114, 270) and tulier "have come", pl., in the phrase I·Eldar tulier "the Eldar have come"(LT1:114, 270). Read probably *utúlientë, *Eldar utúlier in mature Quenya.
	lutte #ettul- *"come forth"

	mol lom- "hide" (LT1:255, that has lomir "I hide"; read *lomin if the word is to be adapted to mature Quenya.)
	mu um- "not do, not be" (1. pers. aorist umin "I do not, am not"), past tense úmë (UGU/UMU). Future tense úva? (q.v.)
	n -n (1) dative ending, in nin, enyalien. Pl. -in, partitive pl. -lin, dual -nt (Plotz)
	n -n (2), also -nyë, pronominal ending, 1. person sg. "I", as in utúlien "I am come" (EO)
	n -n (3) a plural sign used in some of the case endings (WJ:407): Pl. genitive -on, pl. ablative -llon (but also -llor), pl. locative -ssen.
	n n-alalmino ??? (twice in Narqelion; perhaps ne + alalmino)
	na an "for" (Nam, RGEO:66) - but the an of the phrase es sorni heruion an! "the Eagles of the Lords are at hand" (SD:290) seems to denote motion towards (the speaker): the Eagles are coming. Etym has an, ana "to, towards" (NÂ1). In the "Arctic" sentence, an is translated "until".

	nac can- (1) (prefix) ("k") "four" (KÁNAT)

	nagnalayt tyalangan "harp-player" (TYAL)
	naháM Máhan (pl. Máhani attested in WJ:402), one of the eight chiefs of the Valar. (Adopted and adapted from Valarin, but usually translated as Aratar.)

For etymology, see Letters:427. Also Palantir masc. name, "Far-sighted" (Appendix A, SA:palan, PAL, TIR); assimilated palar- in Palarran "Far-Wanderer", name of a ship (palan + ran) (UT:179)
	nalat talan (talam-, e.g. pl. talami) "floor, base, ground" (TALAM)
	nam man "who" (Nam, RGEO:67, FS, LR:59, Markirya, MC:213, 214); cf. PM:357 note 18, where a reference is made to the Eldarin interrogative element ma, man). However, man is translated "what" in LR:59: man-ië? "what is it?" (LR:59; the stative-verb suffix -ië is hardly valid in mature Quenya) Either Tolkien later adjusted the meaning of the word, or man covers both "who" and "what". Cf. also mana, manen.
	nama aman "blessed, free from evil". Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399) Place-name Aman the Blessed Realm, from the stem mân- "good, blessed, unmarred" (SA:mân).

	namurE Eruman desert north-east of Valinor (ERE)
	nan nan "but" (FS); the Etymologies also gives ná, nán (NDAN), but these words may be confused with forms of the verb "to be", so nan should perhaps be preferred.
nán nán (2), also ná, "but, on the contrary, on the other hand" (NDAN; the form nan, q.v., is probably to be preferred to avoid confusion with ná "is").

	naraúN Núaran *"West-king"; Núaran Númenoren *"West-king of Númenor"; changed (according to LR:71) to Núraran Númenen, *"West-king of the West" (all of this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n instead of -o, as in mature Quenya) (LR:60)
narewlI Ilweran, Ilweranta "rainbow" (GL:74) (The Etymologies gives helyanwë.)

	natsadnas sandastan "shield-barrier", a battle-formation (UT:282; probably sandastam- since the final element is derived from a stem stama- "bar, exclude". Compare talan, talam- from TALAM.)

	ne en (1) "there, look! yonder" (EN)
	ne en (2) unidentified word occurring twice in Fíriel's Song; according to the most plausible theory it is an adverbial particle denoting that the action of the following verb took place a long time ago.
	ne en- (3) prefix "re-, again-", in enquantuva "shall refill", entuluva, "shall come again", Envinyatar "Renewer", envinyanta "healed, *renewed", enyalië "to recall" (Nam, RGEO:67, LotR3:V ch. 8, MR:405, UT:317)

	neh hen (hend-, as in pl. hendi) "eye" (KHEN-D-E)
	neidnE Endien alternative term for "autumn" (PM:135). In the Etymologies, the word Endien is assigned a quite different meaning: "Midyear, Midyear week", in the calendar of Valinor a week outside the months, between the sixth and seventh months, dedicated to the Trees; also called Aldalemnar (YEN, LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK)
	neilútna antúlien "hath returned" in the phrase I·cal' antúlien ("k") "Light hath returned" (LT1:270); note the "Qenya" third person ending -n. In mature Quenya this would perhaps read *i cál' enutúlië.

	neirúlaP Palúrien surname of Yavanna (PAL)
	neirúluC Culúrien another name of Laurelin; apparently derived from the stem KUL- "golden-red" (Silm; LR:365)

	nelette ettelen ?"foreign" (gloss not certainly legible) (ET)
	nem men (1) "way" (SA) or "place, spot" (MEN)
	nem men (2) "who", evidently a misreading or miswriting for man (MC:221, in Markirya)
	nemec cemen (cén) ("k") "earth", referring to the earth as a flat floor beneath menel, the heavens (SA:kemen); "soil, earth" (KEM, LT1:257). At one stage, Tolkien intended cemen as the genitive of cén; later cemen became the nominative. 
	nemek kemen "earth"; see cemen.
	nemí ímen a word occurring in Fíriel's Song, translated "in them" (ar ilqua ímen "and all [that is] in them"). Probably not valid in mature Quenya.
	nemís símen "here" (FS; cf. sinomë in EO)
	nemli ilmen region above air where stars are (WIL, SA:ilm-); Ilmen-assa "Chasm of Ilmen" (GAS)
	nemlot tolmen "boss (of shield)" (LT1:269)
	nemór rómen, Rómen "east" (RÔ, MEN, SA:men), "uprising, sunrise, east" (SA:rómen); also name of tengwa 25 (Appendix E). Rómenna, a place in the eastern part of Númenor, is simply the allative "eastward" (SA:rómen), cf. also rómenna in LR:47, 56. Ablative Rómello "from the East" or "[to one] from the East", hence Tolkien's translation "to those from the East" in his rendering of Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67). Masc. name Rómendacil "East-victor" (Appendix A; cf. Letters:425)
	nemraH [Harmen] "south" (MEN) (Changed to hyarmen.)

	nen nen "river" (LT1:248), "river, water" (LT1:262) (In mature Quenya, nén with a long vowel means "water", but hardly "river" - that is sírë.) 
	nén nén (nen-) "water" (NEN).
	nen -nen instrumental ending (pl. -inen, dual -nten, partitive pl. -línen)
	nenam manen "how" (PM:395)
	nenár ránen "errant" (RAN; may be a misreading for *ránëa)

	nenisíN Nísinen *"Flagrance-water", a like in Númenor (UT:168)
	neniU Uinen (Uinend-, as in dative Uinenden) name of a Maia, spouse of Ossë (UY, NEN). Adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:404), though it is also said that it contains -nen "water" (SA:nen); the latter explanation may be folk etymology. In the Etymologies, the name is derived from the same stem (UY) as uilë "long trailing plant, especially seaweed".
	nenúh húnen dat. sg. of huan (KHUGAN, KHUG)
	nerae ëaren "eagle" or "eyrie" (LT1:251; this early "Qenya" word is certainly no more valid than ëa "eagle" in mature Quenya.)
	neramlA Almaren the first abode of the Valar in Arda, apparently related to almarë "blessedness" (Silm, LR:357)
	nere eren, erë "iron" or "steel"; Eremandu variant of Angamandu (Angband) (LT1:252; "iron" should be anga in mature Quenya, but these words may be used for "steel")
	neref feren (fern-, as in pl. ferni) "beech, beech-tree". Also fernë. (BERÉTH, PHER/PHÉREN)
	nereh heren (1) "order"; Heren Istarion "Order of Wizards" (UT:388); (2) "fortune" etymologically "governance" ("and so what is in store for one and what one has in store") (KHER) Herendil masc. name *"Fortune-friend" = Eadwine, Edwin, Audoin (LR:52, 56, cf. the Etymologies, stems KHER-, NIL/NDIL)
	nerem meren (merend-), also merendë "feast, festival" (MBER)
	nerématnacla alcantaméren ("k") "made it shine" (with a fem.pl. subject; the ending -ren probably means "they" of women, but the ending does not have to be translated here) (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	neret teren, terenë "slender" (TER/TERES)
	nesíh hísen "of mist" (MC:221; this may be "Qenya", but it connects with hísë.)
	nessil -lissen or -lissë ending for partitive pl. locative (Plotz); see -li
	nessiracla alcarissen ("k") "in light-rays" (a "Qenya" form from MC:221; alcar means "glory" in mature Quenya)
nésurE Erusén "the children of God" (RGEO:74; this is a weird form with no plural ending. The normal form seems to be Eruhíni.)
	net ten "for", in Fíriel's Song; apparently replaced by an in mature Quenya.
	net ten- "hear", future tense tenuva (MC:213; in mature Quenya, "hear" is hlar-)
	netn -nten ending for dual instrumental (Plotz)
	néuq quén (quen-, as in pl. queni; as final element in compounds -quen) "one, (some)body, person, individual, man or woman", pl. queni = "persons", "(some) people", "they" with the most general meaning (as in "they [= people in general] say that..."). Combined with noun and adjective stems in old compounds to denote habitual occupations or functions, or to describe those having some notable (permanent) quality; examples include roquen, ciryaquen, arquen, q.v. Also in aiquen, ilquen (WJ:361 cf. 360, 372)
neuqayric ciryaquen "shipman, sailor" (WJ:372). 
	neuqia aiquen "if anybody, whoever" (WJ:372)

	neuqra arquen "a noble" (WJ:372)
	neurehemún númeheruen *"of the Lord of the West" (Manwë) (SD:290); this is "Qenya" with genitive in -en instead of -o as in mature Quenya
	neureV rA Ar Veruen *"Day of the Spouses" (Aule and Yavanna) (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK; this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n.)
	neurevrA Arveruen third day of the Valinorian week of 5 days, dedicated to Aule and Yavanna (BES)
	néw wén "greenness, youth, freshness" (GWEN), blended with wendë "maid"
	new wen "maid, girl" (*wend-), in early "Qenya" also wendi (the mature Quenya form wendë occurs in MC:215 and in Etym, stems GWEN, WEN/WENED). (LT1:271, 273) 
	new -wen "maiden", a frequent ending in feminine names like Eärwen *"Sea-maiden" (SA:wen). Early "Qenya" also has -wen feminine patronymic *"daughter of" (LT1:271, 273), but the the patronymic ending seems to be -iel "-daughter" in mature Quenya.
	newlaL Lalwen (also longer Lalwendë) "Laughing Maiden", fem. name (PM:343)
	newle elwen "heart" (LT1:255; rather hón or indo in mature Quenya)
	newlo olwen (olwenn-) "branch, wand, stick" (LT2:342)
	newnaM rA Ar Manwen *"Day of Manwe" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK; this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n.)
	néy yén (pl. yéni in Nam, obsoleting yen[i] in the Etymologies, stem YEN), Elvish "long year" of 144 solar years, 52,596 days (Nam, Appendix D, E; RGEO:66. Tolkien earlier defined yén as 100 solar years; see PM:126; in the Etymologies, stem YEN, it seems to mean simply "year".) Yénonótië *"reckoning of years" (MR:51)
	ney yen, yendë "daughter" (YÔ/YON. This word replaced another form, but the latter may have been restored; see yeldë.)
	ni in a strange particle occurring in the phrase i-coimas in-Eldaron "the coimas [lembas] of the Eldar" in PM:403. It looks like the Sindarin plural article, but in Quenya i is both sg. and pl. "the", and the word Eldar does not normally take any article at all. The alternative reading i-coimas Eldaron (PM:395) is probably to be preferred.
	ni -in dative pl. ending, seen in eldain, fírimoin, q.v.
	niaracla alcarain ("k") "shining" (pl - sg *alcara?) (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	niclah halcin ("k") "frozen" (LT1:254)
	niclih hilcin ("k") is glossed "it freezes"; if this word is to adapted to mature Quenya, it would have to mean "I freeze" (LT1:254)

	nidnamoro oromandin "wood-spirits" (MC:215; this is "Qenya")
	nidnan nandin "fay of the country" (LT1:261)
	nietnauq quantien ("q") "last day of year" (YEN). The word is assigned a different meaning in PM: quantien ("q") "full year" = yén, a period of 144 solar years (PM:126; pl. quantiéni, PM:127). Since the latter meaning comes from drafts for the LotR Appendices that did not make it into the published LotR, it should perhaps be ignored.
nih -hin "child", pl. -híni (as in Eruhíni, "Children of Eru", SA:híni)
nihurE Eruhin pl. Eruhíni "Children of Eru", Elves and Men (WJ:403; SA:híni)

	nileY Yelin "winter" (LT1:260; mature Quenya has hrívë, and Yelin was probably obsoleted together with the adjective yelwa "cold", that appear with a different meaning in the Etymologies).
	nili ilin "pale blue" (GLINDI)
	nilia ailin ("g.sg. ailinen", in mature Quenya dat.sg.) "pool, lake" (AY, LIN1, LT2:339)
	nilip pilin (pilind-, as in pl. pilindi) "arrow" (PÍLIM)
	niliv vilin "airy, breezy" (LT1:273)
	niliw wilin "bird" (LT1:273; if this "Qenya" word is to be used in mature Quenya, it must not be confused with the 1. pers. aorist of the verb wil-)
	nilleróL Lórellin name of the lake where the Valië Estë sleeps; apparently meaning *"Dream-lake" (Silm)
	niluril lirulin "lark" (MR:238, 262), changed from aimenel, aimenal
	nimat tamin "forge" (noun? verb? If it is a verb, this would - at least within the framework of mature Quenya - be the 1. person aorist of a verb tam-; cf. tam- "to tap".) (LT1:250)
	nimól lómin "shade, shadow" (LT1:255)
	nimri irmin "the world, all the regions inhabited by Men" (LT2:343)

	nira arin "morning" (AR1)
niraclA Alcarin "the Glorious", title taken by Atanatar II of Gondor, also name of one of the Kings of Númenor (Appendix A). Is this to be taken as a shorter form of alcarinqua, q.v.?

	nirawliw wilwarin (wilwarind-, as in pl. wilwarindi) "butterfly" (Markirya, WIL, LT1:273); Wilwarin name of a constellation, tentatively identified as Cassiopeia (Silm). "Qenya" adjective wilwarindeën "like butterflies" (MC:216); "Qenya" similative form wilwarindon "as a butterfly" (MC:213, 220) 
	niredneuQ Quenderin "Quendian, belonging to the Elves as a whole" (a learned word) (WJ:407)
	nireleT Telerin "Telerian" (TELES)
	nirevÍ *Iverin (Íverind-), Íverindor "Ireland" (LT2:344) The nominative of Íverind- must be *Íverin, the form Íverind- occurring before endings. Compare Íwerin below..

	niri irin "town" (LT2:343)
	nirif firin "dead" (by natural cause) (PHIR). This may obsolete the earlier "Qenya" word firin "ray of the sun" (LT2:341)

	niripli *ilpirin (hypothetical form; the word actually appears in Q as ilfirin) "immortal" (PHIR)

	nirú úrin "blazing hot" (LT1:271)
	nirú Úrin (Úrind-, as in "g.sg. Úrinden", in mature Quenya this is dat.sg.) a name of the Sun (UR; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it.)
	niruf furin "hidden, concealed" (also hurin) (LT2:340)
	niruh hurin "hidden, concealed" (also furin) (LT2:340)
	nirulaP Palurin "the wide world" (LT1:264)
	nirúT Túrin (masc. name), apparently meaning "victory-mood" (LR:395, stem TUR). The Etymologies gives Turindo as the Quenya form of this name; Túrin seems to be properly the Sindarin form, though it fits Quenya style well enough and Nienor used it in a Quenya sentence (near the end of ch. 21 in the Silmarillion)
	nis sin (1) a word either meaning "thus" (adverb) or "this" (as an independent word in the sentence, not modifying another word like sina does). Attested in the sentence sin quentë Quendingoldo Elendilenna, either *"this Pengolodh said to Elendil" or "thus spoke Pengolodh to Elendil" (PM:401).
	nis sin (2) a form of sí "now" (q.v.) occurring before vowels, possibly replaced by sín (SI)

	niu uin (1) see u-.
	niU Uin (2) "the primeval whale" (LT1:263)
	niul luin "blue", pl. luini (Nam, RGEO:66). In Helluin, name of the star Sirius, and Luinil, name of another blue-shining star (or planet). (SA; Luinil is tentatively identified with Neptune, MR:435)
	niullI Illuin name of one of the Lamps of the Valar; apparently incorporating the element luin "blue" (Silm)
	niullodniM Mindolluin *"Blue Tower" (mindon + luin), name of a mountain. (Christopher Tolkien translates the name as "Towering Blue-head" in the Silmarillion Index, but this seems to be based on the questionable assumption that it includes the Sindarin element dol "head, hill". Unless this translation is given in his father's papers, the name is better explained as a Quenya compound.)
	niuqil liquin ("q") "wet" (LT1:262; mature Quenya has linquë.)
	nivay yavin "bears fruit" (LT1:273; would have to mean "I bear fruit" in mature Quenya; a stem #yav- may be isolated)
	nivet tevin "hatred" (LT1:268); also tevië
	no -on gen.pl. ending (3O), in Silmarillion, Valion, aldaron, aranion, tasarion (see Nan-Tasarion),  Númevalion, Sindaron, Istarion, Ingweron, Quendion, Eldaron.
	no on, ondo "stone" (LT2:342, LT1:254 - probably only ondo in mature Quenya). Various "Qenya" forms: ondoli "rocks" (MC:213; this would be a partitive plural in mature Quenya), ondolin "rocks" (MC:220), ondoisen "upon rocks" (MC:221), ondolissen "rocks-on" (MC:214; the latter form, partitive plural locative, is still valid in mature Quenya)

	noil -lion ending for partitive pl. genitive (Plotz); see -li
	noilaC Calion, Tar-Calion, the Quenya name of King Ar-Pharazôn "the Golden"; Calion would seem to be connected to cal- "shine", cálë "light". (Silm)

	noirom morion "son of the dark" (in Fíriel's Song, Morion is translated "dark one", referring to Melko[r]) (LT1:261)
noiroM Morion "the dark one", a title of Morgoth (FS).
	noirÚ Úrion (Q?) a title of Fionwë (= later Eönwë); see the LR index. (UR; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it.)

	nor -ron gen. pl. ending in aldaron, see alda. The -r is actually the nominative pl. ending, to which is appended the genitive ending -o and a second plural marker, -n.
	norabma ambaron (ambarón- as in "g.sg. ambarónen", in mature Quenya dat.sg.) "uprising, sunrise, Orient" (AM2). The longer form Ambarónë should be preferred, since ambaron is also the dat.sg. of ambar # 1.
	noradlA Aldaron a name of Oromë (GÁLAD, Silm).

	noraynemún númenyaron a word occurring in a phrase from an earlier version of Fíriel's Song, Valion númenyaron, "of the Lords [Valar] of the West". But númenyaron cannot simply mean "of the West"; it seems to be the plural genitive of númenya "western", hence literally *"of the western (things, persons, realms)" or "of the Westerners".
	norénauqnin ninquanéron ("q") "white shining" (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
	nores seron "friend" (SER)

	ó ó- (usually reduced to o- when unstressed) a prefix "used in words describing the meeting, junction, or union of two things or persons, or of two groups thought of as units". In omentië, ónoni, ónona (WJ:367; in the Etymologies, stem WÔ, the prefix o-, ó- is simply defined as "together")

	ocru urco ("k"), pl. urqui, an old word used in the lore of the Blessed Realm for anything that caused fear to the Elves during the March; by the Exiles recognized as the cognate of Sindarin orch and used to mean "Orc". The Sindarin-influenced form orco was also used. (WJ:390)
	ocruar rauco ("k") "a powerful, hostile, and terrible creature", especially in the compound Valarauco "Demon of Might" (WJ:415, cf. SA:raukor. In the Etymologies, stem RUK, the gloss is "demon".) In the compound Valaraucar "Balrogs", the pl. of rauco is surprisingly #raucar instead of *raucor.

Originally pronounced ngoldo (also spelt ñoldo by Tolkien, ÑGOLOD); initial ng had become n in Third Age pronunciation (Appendix E). Pl. Noldor ("Ñoldor"), "the Wise", name of the second clan of the Eldar (WJ:380, 381) 
	odna ando "gate", also name of tengwa 5 (AD, Appendix E)
	odnam mando "custody, safe keeping" (MR:350) or "prison, duress" (in Mandos, q.v.) (SA:band); Mando "the Imprisoner or Binder", usually lenghtened Mandos (MBAD (ÑGUR, GOS/GOTH, SPAN) )
	odnamagnA Angamando "Iron-gaol", Sindarin Angband (MR:350). The Etymologies gives Angamanda "Angband, Hell", lit. "Iron-prison" (MBAD). Older "Qenya" has Angamandu "Hells of Iron" (or pl. Angamandi) (LT1:249)

	odnoy yondo "son" (YÔ/YON); cf. the patronymic ending -ion. Early "Qenya" has yô, yond-, yondo "son" (LT2:342). According to LT2:344, these are poetic words, while yondo is the normal word for "son" in mature Quenya. According to LT2:344, yondo means "male descendant, usually (great) grandson", but in mature Quenya, yondo means "son", and the word is so glossed in LT2:342.

	ogna ango pl. angwi "snake" (ANGWA/ANGU)
	ognal [lango (2) "throat"] (followed by *langwi - this evidently indicates that the pl. of lango is NOT langwi, but rather langor. Contrast ango "snake", pl. angwi. But whatever the case, lango was changed to lanco.) (LANG, see LANK)
	ognal lango (1) "broad sword", also "prow of a ship" (LAG)
	ognat tango "twang" (TING/TANG)
	ognu ungo "cloud, dark shadow" (UÑG)

Oiolairë "Ever-summer" (name of a tree, UT:167; also in the name Coron Oiolairë, "Mound of Ever-summer", assimilated corol- in the contraction Corollairë) (SA:coron); Oiolossë "Everwhite, Ever-snowwhite", a name of Taniquetil (OY), hence the translation "Mount Everwhite" in Tolkien's rendering of Namárië.

Past participle carna, q.v. Some doubtful forms in Fíriel's Song: past tense cárë ("káre") "made"; the form carnë (LR:362) is probably to be preferred in mature Quenya. Also *cárië with various suffixes: cárier ("kárier") is translated "they made"; actually it seems to be an augmentless perfect *"they have made", "they" being simply the plural ending -r. The literal meaning of cárielto ("kárielto") must also be *"they made" (cf. -lto).

rahtavA Avathar name of the land between the southern Pelóri and the Sea, where Ungoliant dwelt; said to be "not Elvish" in WJ:404 and must be thought of as an adaption from Valarin; on the other hand, MR:284 states that it is "ancient Quenya" and offers the interpretation "The Shadows". Whatever the case, it must have become *Avasar in Exilic Quenya.
	rál lár (1) "league", a linear measure, 5000 rangar (q.v.). A ranga was approximately 38 inches, so a lár was "5277 yards, two feet and four inches [ca. 4826 m], supposing the equivalence to be exact" - close enough to our league of 5280 yards to justify this translation. The basic meaning of lár is "pause";  in marches a brief halt was made for each league. (UT:285)

ratanatA Atanatar masc. name, "Father of Men" (Appendix A), also common noun atanatar, pl. Atanatári, "Fathers of Men", a title that "properly belonged only to the leaders and chieftains of the peoples at the time of their entry into Beleriand" (PM:324, SA:atar)
ratannA Annatar "Lord of Gifts, *Gift-lord", name assumed by Sauron when he tried to seduce the Eldar in the Second Age (SA:tar)
	ratavúlI Ilúvatar "All-father", God (FS, IL; Ilúv-atar, ATA); Ilúvatáren "of Ilúvatar"; in the "Qenya" of Fíriel's Song, LR:47 and SD:246, the genitive ending is -en instead of -o as in mature Quenya.

	raum maur "dream, vision" (LT1:261)
ráuq quár (also quárë) "fist" (SA:celeb, KWAR; in the Etymologies, Tolkien first wrote quár pl. quari, and quár is also found in PM:318. As usual, the Etym forms have q instead of qu.) According to PM:318, the "chief use [of this word] was in reference to the tightly closed hand as in using an implement or a craft-tool rather than to the 'fist' as used in punching".
	rauqnirepleyT Tyelperinquar "Silver-fist, Celebrimbor" (PM:318; also Telperinqar, q.v.)
	rava avar "recusant, one who refuses to act as advised or commanded"; pl. Avari Elves that refused to join in the westward march to Aman (WJ:371) The Etymologies gives Avar, Avaro pl. Avari  "Elves who never left Middle-earth or began the march" (AB/ABAR)

raxanaháM Máhanaxar the "Doom Ring" of Aman; adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)

	reiríc círier ("k") "clove" (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	reissemún númessier "they are in the west", a construction occurring in Fíriel's Song, evidently núme(n)-ssë-ie-r "west-in-are-they"; the stative-verb suffix -ië is probably not valid in mature Quenya (FS)

	releT Teler "sea-elf", pl. Teleri, general (partitive) pl. Telelli, the third tribe of the Eldar (TELES (MIS) ), also called Lindar. Teleri means "those at the end of the line, the hindmost", (WJ:382 cf. 371), derived from the stem tel- "finish, end, be last" (SA:tel-). The Lindar were so called because they lagged behind on the march from Cuiviénen. In early "Qenya", Teler, also Telellë, was defined "little elf" (LT1:267), but this is certainly not a valid gloss in mature Quenya.
	rem mer- "wish, desire, want" (the form merë given in Etym seems to be the 3. person sg. aorist, *"wishes, desires, wants"); pa.t. mernë (MER)

	riste etsir "mouth of a river" (ET)
	rit tir- "watch, watch over, guard, heed", 1. pers. aorist tirin "I watch", pa.t. tirnë (TIR), future tense tiruva "shall heed" in Markirya (also MC:213, 214); also in CO with pronominal endings: tiruvantes "they will guard it" (tir-uva-nte-s "guard-will-they-it"). The stem also occurs in palantíri (q.v.), Tirion "Great Watchtower", a city of the Elves (SA:tir; in MR:176 the translation is "Watchful City")
	ritalah halatir (halatirn-, as in dat.sg. halatirnen), also halatirno, "kingsfisher", etymologically "fish-watcher" (TIR, SKAL2, KHAL1)

	rocleM Melkor (spelt Melcor in MR:362), the rebellious Vala, the devil of the Silmarillion mythos. Older form Melkórë "Mighty-rising" (hence the interpretation "He that arises in power"). Oldest form *mbelekôro (WJ:402). Melkorohíni "Children of Melkor", Orcs ("but the wiser say: nay, the slaves of Melkor; but not his children, for Melkor had no children") (MR:416)

	roip pior ??? (Narqelion)
	rol lor- "to slumber" (LT1:259; the corresponding abstract noun lórë "slumber" is attested in mature Quenya, so this verb must still be valid). Cf. also lor "dream" (Letters:308; probably just an Elvish "element" rather than a complete word)
	roll -llor ending for plural ablative; also -llon
	rolo olor "dream", noun (LOS, ÓLOS, LT1:259 [the latter source also gives olórë]); perhaps changed by Tolkien to olos, q.v. 
	rolos solor "surf" (SOL); solor, solossë "surf, surge" (LT1:266)

	ronaemól… Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurëa Lómëanor "Forestmanyshadowed-deepvalleyblack Deepvalleyforested Gloomyland", Quenya elements agglutinated in Entish fashion; this supposedly means something like "there is a black shadow in the deep dales of the forest" (LotR2:III ch. 4; translated in Appendix F under "Ents"; cf. also Letters:308)

Full form Valinórë (BAL; Vali-nórë under NDOR) In the early "Qenya Lexicon", Valinor, Valinórë is glossed "Asgard", the name of the city of the gods in Norse mythology (LT1:272). Possessive (here object genitive) Valinóreva in Nurtalë Valinóreva, the "Hiding of Valinor" (Silm).

rovurim miruvor, full form miruvórë "meed", "a special wine or cordial"; possessive miruvóreva "of meed" (Nam, RGEO:66; WJ:399) In the "Qenya Lexicon", miruvórë was defined "nectar, drink of the Valar" (LT1:261).
	rú úr "fire" (UR) This stem was struck out in Etym, but a word that must be derived from it occurs in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it. Early "Qenya" also has Ûr "the Sun" (also Úri, Úrinci ("k"), Urwen) (LT1:271). Cf. Úri.
	rud -dur see -ndur 
rudleneM Meneldur masc. name, *"Heaven-servant" (Appendix A)
rudlisI Isildur (masc.name., *"Moon-servant") (SA:sil, Appendix A, NDÛ)
	rudn -ndur (also -dur) ending in some names, like Eärendur; as noted by Christopher Tolkien in the Silmarillion Appendix it has much the same meaning as -ndil "friend"; yet -ndur properly means "servant of" (SA:(n)dil), "as one serves a legitimate master: cf. Q. arandil king's friend, royalist, beside arandur 'king's servant, minister'. But these often coincide: e.g. Sam's relation to Frodo can be viewed either as in status -ndur, in spirit -ndil." (Letters:286)
	rudnalaV Valandur masc. name, *"Vala-servant" (Appendix A)
	rudnelE Elendur masc. name, *"Star-servant", probably intended to mean *"Elf-servant"; in effect a variant of Elendil (Appendix A)

	so os (ost-) "house, cottage" (LT2:336; hardly valid in mature Quenya - use coa or mar)
	sodnaM Mandos (Mandost-) "Castle of Custody" (the approximate meaning, according to MR:350) Used as the name of a Vala, properly the place where he dwells (the Halls of Mandos), while his real name is Námo (WJ:402).
