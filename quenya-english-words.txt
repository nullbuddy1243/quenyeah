  † = poetic or archaic word  (e.g. †él "star"  vs.  elen, tinwë)  or a poetic or archaic meaning of an ordinary word (e.g. russë "corruscation, †swordblade"), * = unattested form or translation, ** = wrong form, ¤ = "reconstructed”/prehistoric form mentioned by Tolkien (and by him usually marked with an asterisk, here reserved for post-Tolkien reconstructions), # = form that is only attested in a compound or as an inflected form (e.g. #ahya-). Brackets indicate forms struck out by Tolkien.

The spelling used in this wordlist is regularized (c for k except in a few names, x for ks, long vowels marked with accents rather than macrons or circumflexes;  the diaeresis is used as in most of LotR).  The spelling used in the source is usually indicated; for instance, ("k") following a word indicates that the word is spelt with a k instead of a c in Tolkien's text. When s in a word represents earlier þ (th as in "thing") and it should be spelt with the letter súlë instead of silmë in Tengwar writing (though Tolkien himself sometimes ignored or forgot this), this is indicated by (þ) immediately following the word in question (see for instance asëa aranion). When n in a word represents earlier ñ (ng as in "thing") and should be spelt with the letter noldo rather than númen in Tengwar writing, this is indicated by (ñ) immediately following the word in question (see for instance Noldomar). When the word is actually spelt with ñ instead of n in the source, this is indicated by ("ñ") immediately following the word in question (see for instance nandë #2).

Wordlist last updated August 22, 2013

<A> 
  	a (1) vocative particle "O" in a vanimar "O beautiful ones" (LotR3:VI ch. 6, translated in Letters:308); also attested repeatedly in VT44:12 (cf. 15): A Hrísto *"o Christ", A Eruion  *"o God the son/son of God", a Aina Fairë *"o Holy Spirit", a aina Maria *"o holy Mary".
	a (2) conj. "and", a variant of ar occurring in Fíriel's Song (that also has ar; a seems to be used before words in f-, but contrast ar formenna *”and northwards” in a late text, VT49:26). According to PE17:41, “Old Quenya” could have the conjunction a (as a variant of ar) before n, ñ, m, h, hy, hw (f is not mentioned), PE17:71 adding ty, ny, hr, hl, ñ, l, r,  þ, s. See ar #1. It may be that the a or the sentence nornë a lintieryanen “he ran with his speed” (i.e. as quickly as he could) is to be understood as this conjunction, if the literal meaning is *“he ran and [did so] with his speed” (PE17:58).
	a (3), also á, imperative particle. An imperative with “immediate time reference” is expressed by á in front of the verb (or “occasionally after it, sometimes before and after for emphasis”), with the verb following in “the simplest form also used for the uninflected ‘aorist’ without specific time reference past or present or future” (PE17:93). Cf. a laita te, laita te! "[o] bless them, bless them!", á vala Manwë! "may Manwë order it!", literally *"o rule Manwë!" (see laita, vala for reference); cf. also á carë *“do[!]”, á ricë “try!”, á lirë “sing[!]”, á menë “proceed[!]”, a norë “run[!]” (PE17:92-93, notice short a in this example), á tula *"come!" (VT43:14). In the last example, the verb tul- “come” receives an ending -a that probably represents the suffixed form of the imperative particle, this apparently being an example of the imperative element occurring both “before and after” the verbal stem “for emphasis” (PE17:93). This ending may also appear on its own with no preceding a/á, as in the command queta “speak!” (PE17:138). Other examples of imperatives with suffixed -a include cena and tira (VT47:31, see cen-, tir-); the imperatives of these same verbs are however also attested as á tirë, á cenë (PE17:94) with the imperative particle remaining independent and the following verb appearing as an uninflected aorist stem. This aorist can be plural to indicate a 3rd person pl. subject: á ricir! “let them try!” (PE17:93). Alyë (VT43:17, VT44:9) seems to be the imperative particle a with the pronominal suffix -lyë "you, thou" suffixed to indicate the subject who is to carry out the command; attested in the phrase alyë anta *"give thou" (elided aly' in VT43:11, since the next word begins in e-: aly' eterúna me, *"do thou deliver us"); presumably other pronominal suffixes could likewise be added. The particle a is also present in the negative imperatives ala, #ála or áva, q.v.
a- (1) prefix occurring in the word Atalante, said to denote "complete". Probably just a prefixed stemvowel; cf. a root like ANÁR, said to be derived from NAR. (TALÁT)
	a- (2) a prefix occurring in the Markirya poem (Tolkien first used na-, then changed it). It may be prefixed to verbal stems following a noun that is the object of sense-verbs like "see" and "hear" when the verb it is prefixed to describes what happens to this noun, as in man cenuva lumbor ahosta[?] (changed from na-hosta), "who shall see the clouds gather?" (hosta = "gather").
	acas (“k”) noun “neck” (the bony part of the neck, not including throat), pl. axi (“ks”) (and so perhaps general stem-form ax-). Also sg. axë (said to be a “later” form apparently replacing acas). The word is also used geographically of rock ridges. (PE17:92)
	acca ("k") adv. "too" (= excessively, as in "too big") (PE13:108)
	accar- vb. “do back; react; requite, avenge” (PE17:166). Also ahtar-. (The note containing this form was struck out, but the related Sindarin word acharn “vengeance” appears in the narratives.)
	Acairis ("k") fem. name, "bride" (LT1:252; in Tolkien's later Quenya, "bride" is rather indis)
	acúna ("k") see cúna
	Ae (Quenya?) noun "day" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK - ae was written over ar [# 2] in the names of the Valinorean week, but ar was not struck out.)
	aha noun "rage", also name of tengwa #11, earlier called harma (Appendix E)
	ahosta see hosta
	ahtar- “do back; react; requite, avenge” (PE17:166). Also accar-. (The note containing this form was struck out, but the related Sindarin word acharn “vengeance” appears in the narratives.)
	#ahya- vb. "change" (intransitive), only attested in the past tense: ahyanë (PM:395)
	ai! interjection  "Ah!", "Alas!" (Nam, RGEO:66; also twice in Narqelion, untranslated.) In one (abandoned) version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer, Tolkien may seem to use ai as a vocative particle: ai Ataremma ?"o our Father" (VT43:10, 13)
	aia interjection "hail", variant of aiya (VT43:28)
	aian noun “a holy thing or object or place”, later form of áyan (PE17:149)
	aica (1) ("k") adj. "sharp" (AYAK) or "fell, terrible, dire" (PM:347; according to PM:363 seldom applied to evil things). In Aicanáro, q.v.
	aica (2) ("k") adj. "broad, vast" (LT2:338 - this early "Qenya" form is probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
	aicalë ("k") noun "a peak" (AYAK)
Aicanáro ("k") masc. name "Sharp Flame, Fell Fire"; Sindarized as Aegnor. (So in SA:nár and PM:345; MR:323 has Aicanár. VT41:14, 19 instead gives Ecyanáro as the Q form of Aegnor.)
	aicassë ("k") (1) noun "mountain peak" (AYAK)
aicassë ("k") (2) noun "pinetree" (GL:17; this "Qenya" word is evidently obsoleted by #1 above.)
	ailin ("g.sg. ailinen", in Tolkien's later Quenya dat.sg.) "pool, lake" (AY, LIN1, LT2:339). Fem. name Ailinel (likely *Ailinell-), perhaps ailin + the feminine ending -el (as in aranel "princess"), hence *"Lake-woman" or similar (UT:210).
#ailinë (nominative uncertain) noun "shore, beach" (in Tolkien's later Quenya rather hresta). Only attested in inflected forms: sg. ablative ailinello "shore-from" (MC:213), sg. locative ailinisse "on shore" (MC:221), pl. locative ailissen "on beaches" (for *ailinissen?) (MC:221)
	ailo noun "lake, pool" (LT2:339; Tolkien's later Quenya has ailin)
	aimenal, aimenel - see lirulin
	aina- (1) vb. “to hallow, bless, treat as holy” (PE17:149)
	aina (2) adj "holy" (AYAN), derived from Ainu. Adopted and adapted from Valarin. According to VT43:32, the word is "obsolete, except in Ainur", apparently suggesting that airë or airëa (q.v.) was the normal term for "holy" in later Quenya. However, Tolkien repeatedly used aina in his translation of the Litany of Loreto: Aina Fairë "Holy Spirit", Aina Neldië "Holy Trinity", Aina Maria "Holy Mary", Aina Wendë "Holy Virgin". He also used Aina Eruontari for "holy Mother" in his rendering of the Sub Tuum Praesidium (WJ:399, FS, SA, VT43:32, VT44:5, 12, 17-18)
	ainas noun “a hallow, a fane”, perhaps with stem ainass- (PE17:149). Compare yána #2.
	Aini noun feminine form of Ainu (AYAN, LT1:248); see Ainu.
	ainima adj. “blessed, holy (of things)” (PE17:149)
	Aino noun "god", within Tolkien's mythos a synonym of Ainu (but since Aino is basically only a personalized form of aina "holy", hence "holy one", it could be used as a general word for "god") (PE15:72)
	Ainu noun "holy one, angelic spirit"; fem. Aini (AYAN, LT1:248); "one of the 'order' of the Valar and Maiar, made before Eä"; pl. Ainur is attested. Adopted and adapted from Valarin ayanūz (WJ:399). In the early "Qenya Lexicon", ainu was glossed "a pagan god", and aini was similarly "a pagan goddess", but as Christopher Tolkien notes, "Of course no one within the context of the mythology can call the Ainur 'pagan' " (LT1:248). Ainulindalë noun "Music of the Ainur" (SA:lin #2), the First History (WJ:406), the Song of Creation (AYAN) 
aipio noun "plum tree, cherry tree" (GL:18)
	aiqua ("q") adj. "steep" (AYAK). Not to be confused with the pronoun *aiqua “if anything, whatever” that post-Tolkien writers have extrapolated from aiquen (q.v.) on the basis of such pairs as ilquen vs. ilqua (q.v.)
	aiqualin ("q") adj. "tall", plural form (???) (MC:216; this is "Qenya" - but cf. aiqua above.)
	aiquen pron. "if anybody, whoever" (WJ:372)
	aira (1) adj. "red, copper-coloured, ruddy" (GAY)
	aira (2) adj. "holy"; see airë #1
	aira (3) adj. "old" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	[aira (4) adj. "eternal" (EY, VT45:13). Changed by Tolkien to oira.]
	airë (1) adj. "holy", #Airefëa "the Holy Spirit" (VT43:37, dative airefëan on the previous page), airetári or Airë Tári "holy queen" (a title of Varda, PM:363), genitive aire-tário "holy-queen's" (Nam, RGEO:67). However, according to PM:363, airë is the noun "sanctity", while aira is the adjective "holy". VT43:14 refers to an etymological note of "Sept.-Oct. 1957" where airë is said to be a noun "sanctity, holiness", and the adjective "holy" is given as airëa. However, the verb #airita- "hallow" seems to be formed from an adjective airë, airi- "holy". Evidently airë can function as both adjective ("holy") and noun ("holiness"); if so airë as adj. could represent a primitive adjective *gaisi, whereas airë as noun may descend from  *gaisē. The former but not the latter would have the stem airi- (as observed in the derived verb #airita-), and compounds like airetári (rather than *airitári) would seem to contain properly the noun "holiness".
	airë (2) noun "sea" (the form airen is given, intended as a genitive singular when Tolkien wrote this; in LotR-style Quenya it would rather be a dative sg.) (AYAR/AIR; cf. airon)
	[airë (3) noun "eternity" (EY, VT45:13)]
	airëa adj. "holy"; see airë.
	#airita- vb. "hallow" (only pa.t. airitánë is attested) (VT32:7)
	airon noun “ocean” (PE17:27). Also ëaron, q.v.
	aista (1) adj. "holy" (VT43:37)
	#aista- (2) vb. "to bless", verbal stem isolated from the passive participle aistana "blessed" (VT43:30)
	aista- (3) vb. "to dread" (GÁYAS, VT45:14; possibly obsoleted by #2 above)
	aiwë noun "(small) bird" (AIWĒ, SA:lin #1); Aiwendil "Lover of Birds" (UT:401)
	Aiwenor, Aiwenorë (read *Aiwenórë?) place-name "Birdland" = lower air (AIWĒ) 
	aiya interjection "hail", as greeting (LotR2:IV ch. 9, see Letters:385 for translation), or a call “for help and attention” (PE17:89), “only addressed to great or holy persons as the Valar, or to Earendil” (PE17:149). Variant aia (VT43:28)
	'al- (1) vb. "thrive" (GALA; the ' simply indicates that the original initial G has disappeared and needs not normally be included, PE17:100) Other sources hint at the meaning “grow” (cf. the root GAL meaning “grow, be healthy; to grow [like a plant]”, PE17:153). Compare ala- #4 and #alála- (and cf. ol-).
	al (2) an assimilated form of the conjunction ar before l (PE17:41, 175); see ar #1. 
	ala, #ála (1) imperative particle á, a combined with the negation lá, -la "not" to express a prohibition (VT43:22; see lá #1). Also with 1st person suffix -lyë (alalyë and álalyë, VT43:10, 22, VT44:8) and 1st person pl. object suffix -më (alamë and álamë, "do not [do something to] us", as in álamë tulya, "do not lead us", VT43:12, 22). In the essay Quendi and Eldar, negative imperatives are rather indicated by áva, q.v., but this form can well coexist with ala, #ála.
ala- (2) negative prefix "not", "un-", reduced to al- before a vowel (VT42:33, GALA, VT45:25), though the example Alcorin would suggest that al- can sometimes appear before a consonant as well. In a deleted entry in Etym, al(a)- was defined as "not" and said to be a "pure negative" (VT45:5). In alahasta, Alamanyar, alasaila, Alcorin.
ala- (3), also al-, a prefix expressing “good” or “well” (PE17:146), as in alaquenta (q.v.) Whether Tolkien imagined this ending to coexist with the negative prefix of the same form (#2 above) is unclear and perhaps dubious. 
ala- (4) vb. “plant, grow” (the first gloss would suggest that the following one is transitive: to “grow” plants) (PE17:100). Compare al- “thrive, *grow” (which however seems intransitive). 
	ala (5) prep. "after, beyond" (MC:221, 214; however, LotR-style Quenya has han and pella "beyond" and apa "after")
	[ala (6) (also alar! or alla!) interjection "hail, blessed be (thou)". (VT45:5,14)]
	[ala (7) noun "day", also alan "daytime". The forms allen, alanen listed after these words could be inflected forms of them, genitive "of daytime", constracted (allen = al'nen) and uncontracted. However, Tolkien struck out all of this (VT45:13).]
	alaco ("k") noun "rush, rushing flight, wild wind" (VT45:5 cf. ÁLAK)
alahasta adj. "unmarred" (MR:254)
alaië, see lá #1
#alála- vb *"to continually grow" (VT27:20, 25), maybe the frequentative form of a simpler verb al- or ala- "to grow". Cf. 'al- "thrive".
alalmë (1) noun “inflorescence” (PE17:153), cf. alma #2.
	alalmë (2) noun "elm, elm-tree" (ÁLAM, LÁLAM, LT1:249). Cf. alvë in a post-LotR source.
	alalmino noun? "Elm"-something? (Narqelion)
	Alalminórë, untranslated word heading a section of the poem The Trees of Kortirion and also occurring in the poem itself (LT1:39, 41), perhaps *“land (nórë) [of] elms (alalmi)”. 
	alalvëa adj. “having many elms” (PE17:146). Cf. alalvinorë. 
alalvinorë noun “land of many Elms” (PE17:153), read apparently -nórë as in the alternate form alalbinórë (late pronunciation with lb for lv)
	#Alamanya pl. Alamanyar noun, name of the Elves who started on the march from Cuiviénen but did not reach Aman; = Úmanyar (MR:163) 
	álamë, see me
 [alan, alanen – see ala #5]
alanessë, see alenessë
alaquenta adj. “well (happily) said” (PE17:146)
	[alar! (also ala and alla!) interjection "hail, blessed be (thou)". (VT45:5,14, 26)]
	[Aláriel, masc. name = "Eadwine", friend of fortune (but this name is elsewhere rendered into Quenya as Herendil, q.v.) (VT45:26)]
	alarca ("k") adj. "swift, rapid" (LAK2)
alas (alast-) noun "marble" (QL:30, GL:39).
alasaila adj. "unwise" (VT41:13, 18; VT42:33)
	alassë (1) noun "joy, merriment" (GALÁS) [VT42:32; a gloss "mirth" was deleted, VT45:14]
	[alassë (2) interjection "hail" or "bless", evidently a synonym of the greeting alar!, q.v. (VT45:26)]
	alat- prefix "large, great in size". (ÁLAT, cf. VT45:5). In Alatairë.
	Alatairë place-name "Great Sea", name of the Western Ocean between Beleriand and Valinor, called Belegaer in Sindarin (ÁLAT, AYAR/AIR)
	[alatúlië ?noun/?interjection “welcome” (PE17:172)]
	[alatulya adj./interjection “welcome” (PE17:172)]
	albë, see alvë
	alca ("k") noun "ray of light" (AKLA-R)
	alcantaméren ("k") vb. "made it shine" (with a fem.pl. subject; the ending -ren probably means "they" of women, but the ending does not have to be translated here) (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	alcar (so spelt in CO, VT43:37-38, and VT44:32/34; otherwise "alkar") noun "glory, radiance, brilliance, splendour" (WJ:369, CO, VT43:37-38, VT47:13, AKLA-R; the latter source also lists an alternative longer form alcarë, also occurring in VT44:7/10) – Compare Alcarin, Atanalcar.
alcarin adj. “glorious, brilliant” (shorter form of alcarinqua, q.v.) (PE17:24), hence Alcarin masc. name (or title) "the Glorious", title taken by Atanatar II of Gondor, also name of one of the Kings of Númenor (Appendix A). 
alcarinqua adj. "radiant, glorious" (AKLA-R [there spelt "alkarinqa"], WJ:412, VT44:7/10), “glorious, brilliant” (PE17:24), noun Alcarinquë, "The Glorious", name of a star/planet (SA:aglar - there spelt "Alkarinquë", but the Silmarillion Index has "Alcarinquë". The celestial body in question seems to be Jupiter, MR:435). Cf. also Alcarin, q.v.
	alcarain ("k") adj.? "shining" (pl - sg *alcara?) (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	alcarissen ("k") noun "in light-rays" (a "Qenya" form from MC:221; alcar means "glory" in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Alcorin ("k") adj. variant of Ilcorin, q.v. (VT45:5, 25)
	alda noun "tree" (GALAD, GÁLAD, SA, Nam, RGEO:66, LR:41, SD:302, LT1:249, LT2:340, VT39:7), also name of tengwa #28 (Appendix E). Pl. aldar in Narqelion; gen. pl. aldaron "of trees" in Namárië. Etymology of alda, see Letters:426 and UT:266-7. The latter source states that primitive ¤galadā, whence Quenya alda, originally applied to stouter and more spreading trees such as oaks or beeches, while straighter and more slender trees such as birches were called ¤ornē, Quenya ornë - but this distinction was not always observed in Quenya, and it seems that alda became the general word. According to PE17:25, primitive galada (sic) referred to “a plant (large) and was a general term”. Place-name Aldalómë “”tree-night” or “tree-shade-night” (LotR2:III ch. 4, translated in PE17:82); Aldarion masc. name, *"Son of (the) Trees" (Appendix A), Tar-Aldarion a Númenorean King (UT:210). Aldaron a name of Oromë (Silm); aldinga "tree-top" (VT47:28), aldarembina (pl. aldarembinë attested) adj. “tree-tangled”, the cognate of Sindarin galadhremmin (PM:17:26). Aldúya fourth day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Trees (Appendix D). The word seems to include *Aldu, a dual form referring to the Two Trees. The Númenóreans altered the name to Aldëa (presumably < *aldajā), referring to one tree (the White) only. The dual Aldu seems to occur also in Aldudénië "Lament for the Two Trees" (a strange word, since Quenya does not permit intervocalic d as in this word – perhaps the Vanyarin dialect of Quenya did) (Silm) 
	Aldalemnar noun "week of the Trees, Midyear week" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK (GÁLAD, YEN) )
	Aldaron noun, a name of Oromë (GÁLAD)
	aldarwa adj "having trees, tree-grown" (3AR). See -arwa.
	Aldëa noun, what the Númenóreans called the fourth day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to Telperion, the White Tree (Appendix D). The day was originally called Aldúya, referring to both of the Two Trees, but Númenóreans altered the name to Aldëa (presumably < *aldajā), referring to one tree (the White) only. (Appendix D) – Early "Qenya" also has an adjective aldëa "tree-shadowed" (LT1:249).
	aldëon noun "avenue of trees" (LT1:249)
	alenessë, also alanessë, noun “nicotiana, pipeweed” (tobacco) (PE17:100)
	aldinga noun "treetop" (VT47:28)
	alima adj. “fair, good” (also alya) (PE17:146)
	[alla! (also alar! or ala) interjection "hail, blessed be (thou)". (VT45:5, 14)] PE17:146 cites alla “hail, welcome” as a variant (occurring within the imaginary world) of aiya.
	allë prep. with pron. suffix *”beside you” (formal) (VT49:25); see ara
	[allen – see ala #5.]
	alma (1) noun "good fortune, weal, wealth". In a deleted entry in Etym, the glosses were "riches, (good) fortune, blessedness"; in another deleted entry, Tolkien provided the glosses "growth" and maybe "increase" (reading uncertain), also "good fortune, riches" (GALA [ALAM], VT45:5, 13, 14)
	alma (2) “flower” (PE17:153), said to be the “usual Quenya word” or “general Quenya word” (i.e. for flower), but its coexistence with #1 is problematic. Compare lós, lótë, lotsë, indil.  
	almarë noun "blessedness, 'blessings', good fortune, bliss". In deleted entries in Etym, the glosses provided were "blessedness, prosperity, bliss" (GALA, VT45:5, 14)
	almárëa adj. "blessed". In a deleted entry in Etym, the gloss provided was "bless", but this would seem to be a mistake, since the word does not look like a verb. Another deleted entry agrees with the retained entry GALA that almárëa means "blessed" (GALA, VT45:5, 14)
	Almaren place-name, the first abode of the Valar in Arda, apparently related to almarë "blessedness" (Silm, LR:357)
	Almáriel fem. name, apparently containing almarë "blessedness" (GALA, VT45:5, 14)
	almë noun “a good thing, a ‘blessing’, a piece of good fortune” (PE17:146). Cf. alma, almië.
	almië noun "blessedness, 'blessings', good fortune, bliss". In deleted entries in Etym, the glosses were "blessedness, prosperity, bliss" (GALA, VT45:5, 14)
	Almiel fem. name, perhaps *"daughter of blessedness": almië + -iel with contraction / haplology.
	alqua noun "swan" (ÁLAK [there spelt alqa, as in LT1:249/LT2:335], SA:alqua, UT:265, VT42:7). The alternative form alquë ("q") mentioned in early material (LT1:249) may or may not be valid in LotR-style Quenya. 
Alqualondë place-name "Swan-road, Swan-haven", capital of the Teleri (ÁLAK, LOD, KHOP [there spelt Alqalonde], Silm).
	Alquarámë ("q") noun "Swan-wing" (LT2:335)
	alta (1) adj. *"large, great in size" (root meaning) (ÁLAT). Alat- in Alatairë, q.v.
	alta (2) noun "radiance" (VT42:32, PE17:50). Cf. variant ñalta.
	[alta- (3) vb. "grow" (VT45:13) or "make grow" (VT45:14)]
	Altariel fem. name "Galadriel", "maiden crowned with a radiant garland" (SA:kal; the form Alatáriel is Telerin; see PM:347) Stem Altariell- seen in the genitive Altariello, occurring in the superscript of the Tengwar transcription of Namárië in RGEO.
	alu noun "dressed leather" (QL:30)
	alvë noun “elm” (PE17:146), also pronounced albë. In an earlier source, the word for “elm” is given as alalmë, lalmë. 
	[alwa adj. "healthy, strong, flourishing" (+ one gloss not certainly legible: ?"well grown") (VT45:14)]
	alya (1) adj. “fair, good” (PE17:146), "prosperous, rich, abundant, blessed" (GALA). In a deleted entry in Etym, the glosses provided were "rich, blessed"; another deleted entry defined alya as "rich, prosperous, blessed". (GALA, [ÁLAM], VT42:32, 45:5, 14)
	alya- (2) vb. “to cause to prosper, bless (a work), help one” (PE17:146)
	alyë imperative particle with ending -lyë "you"; see a #3.
	am- (1) prefix "up" (AM2)
	am- (2) prefix used in comparison, “signifying addition, increase” (PE17:90), or with genitive superlative: elenion ancalima “brightest of stars” (PE17:91). Originally identical with #1 above. The form am- as such is in late Quenya only used before p and (presumably) before vowels; the longer form ama- came to be preferred before r and l; before other consonants, the prefix assumes the form an- (pronounced, but not in Romanized Quenya orthography written, añ- before c) (PE17:90-92). Phonologically we would expect am- before y- (since my is an acceptable Quenya combination); however, Tolkien used an- in the word anyára (q.v.) See an- #2 and compare ar- #2. 
	ama adv.? element not glossed, evidently meaning "up" like the prefix am-, or an alternative form of amba (UNU)
	amal noun “mother”; also emel (VT48:22, 49:22); the form amil (emil) seems more usual.
	amaldar ??? (Narqelion; may include aldar "trees")
	aman adj. "blessed, free from evil". Adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:399), though in other versions Tolkien cited an Elvish etymology (cf. VT49:26-27). Place-name Aman the Blessed Realm, from the stem mān- "good, blessed, unmarred" (SA:mān), translated “Unmarred State” (VT49:26). Allative Amanna (VT49:26). Adj. amanya "of Aman, *Amanian" (WJ:411), nominal pl. Amanyar "those of Aman", Elves dwelling there (with negations Úamanyar, Alamanyar "those not of Aman"). Also fuller Amaneldi noun *"Aman-elves" (WJ:373). Masc. name Amandil *"Aman-friend" (Appendix A, SA:mān), the father of Elendil; also name of the Númenorean king Tar-Amandil (UT:210).
	?amandi pl. of óman, q.v. (amandi is evidently a misreading for *omandi, VT46:7) (OM)
	amanya adj. “blessed” (VT49:39, 41)
	Amarië fem. name; perhaps derived from mára "good" with prefixing of the stem-vowel and the feminine ending -ië (Silm)
	amarto noun "Fate" (also ambar) (LT2:348; in LotR-style Quenya rather umbar, umbart-)
	amatixë ("ks") noun dot or point placed above the line of writing (TIK). Tolkien rejected the variant amatexë ("ks") (VT46:20)
	[amatúlië noun “blessed arrival” (PE17:172), replaced by alatúlië, q.v.]
	[amatulya adj./?interjection “welcome (of something blessed)” (PE17:172), replaced by alatulya, q.v.]
†amaurëa noun "dawn, early day" (Markirya)
	amba 1) adv. "up, upwards" (AM2, PE17:157). Apparently also ama (UNU).
	amba 2) adj. and noun “more”, “used of any kind of measurement spatial, temporal, or quantitative” (PE:17:91). Cf. adverb ambë.
	ambal noun "shaped stone, flag" (MBAL)
	Ambalar noun "East" (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	ambalë noun "yellow bird, 'yellow hammer' " (SMAL)
	*ambalotsë noun "uprising-flower", referring to "the flower or floreate device used as a crest fixed to point of a tall [illegible word: ?archaic] helmet". Curiously, the word is asterisked as unattested (WJ:319)
	amban noun "upward slope, hill-side" (AM2)
	ambapenda adj. "uphill". Also ampenda. (AM2)
	ambar (1) ("a-mbar") noun "oikumenē [Greek: the earth as the human habitation], Earth, world" (MBAR), stem ambar- (PE17:66), related to and associated with mar "home, dwelling" (VT45:33); in VT46:13 the latter glosses are possibly also ascribed to the word ambar itself (the wording is not clear). The form ambaren also listed in the Etymologies was presumably intended as the genitive singular at the time of writing (in LotR-style Quenya it would rather be the dative singular); in the printed version in LR, the misreading "ambaron" appears (see VT45:33). Ambar-metta noun "the end of the world" (EO); spelt ambarmetta in VT44:36. The element #umbar in Tarumbar "King of the World" (q.v.) would seem to be a variant of ambar, just like ambar #2 "doom" also alternates with umbar (see below).
	ambar (2) noun "fate, doom" (variant of umbar?) in Turambar (SA:amarth); stem ambart- (PE17:66), instrumental ambartanen "by doom" (Silm ch. 21, UT:138, PE17:66). The early "Qenya" lexicon has ambar "Fate", also amarto (LT2:348)
	ambar (3) noun "”breast” (chest), with stem in -s- or -r- (QL:30). The form ambar, translated “in bosom”,  occurs in MC:213 (this is "Qenya"). Note: if this word were to be adapted to LotR-style Quenya, we should probably have to read *ambas with stem ambar-; compare olos, olor- “dream” from a late source. However, the form ambos (q.v.) is less ambiguous and may be preferred.
	Ambarenya, older [MET] Ambarendya place-name "Middle-earth" (but the more usual word is Endor, Endórë) (MBAR)
	ambaron (ambarón- as in "g.sg. ambarónen", in LotR-style Quenya this would be a dative singular) noun "uprising, sunrise, Orient" (AM2). - In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the form ambaron also appears in the entry MBAR, but according to VT45:33 this is an error for ambaren, apparently intended as the genitive singular of ambar (in LotR-style Quenya it would rather be the dative singular).
	Ambaróna place-name “Eastern (land)”, possibly basically an adjectival form Ambarónë "uprising, sunrise, Orient" (LotR2:III ch. 4; PE17:82, compare the Etymologies, entry AM2)
	Ambarónë noun "uprising, sunrise, Orient" (AM2)
	Ambarto masc. name *"upwards-exalted", mother-name (never used in narrative) of Pityafinwë = Amrod (PM:353, 354)
	*ambas, see ambar # 3
	ambassë noun “breast-plate, hauberk”
	Ambarussa masc. name "top-russet", alternation of Umbarto, mother-name (never used in narrative) of Telufinwë = Amras (PM:353-354)
	ambë adv. “more”, “used of any kind of measurement spatial, temporal, or quantitative” (PE17:91). As noun or adjective, amba.
	ambela adv. “further still beyond, far away beyond” (PE17:91)
	ambena adv. “nearer to (to a further point in the motion) towards an object” (PE17:91). Also amna.
	ambo noun "hill, rising ground” (Markirya, PE17:92), “mount” (PE17:157), allative pl. ambonnar "upon hills" in Markirya (ruxal' ambonnar "upon crumbling hills") According to VT45:5, ambo was added to the Etymologies as a marginal note.
	ambos (ambost-) noun “breast” (chest). –PE16:82
	ambuna adj. “of flat ground dotted with hills etc.” (PE17:93)
	ámen, see me
	amil noun "mother" (AM1), also emil (q.v.) Longer variant amillë (VT44:18-19), compounded Eruamillë "Mother of God" in Tolkien's translation of the Hail Mary (VT43:32). If amil is a shortened form of amillë, it should probably have the stem-form amill-. Also compare amilyë, amya, emya. Compounded amil- in amilessë noun "mothername" (cf. essë "name"), name given to a child by its mother, sometimes with prophetic implications (amilessi tercenyë "mother-names of insight"). (MR:217).
	Amillion noun "February" (LT1:249; LotR-style Quenya has Nénimë)
	amilyë or milyë (cited as (a)milyë), noun "mummy", also used as a play-name of the index finger, but Tolkien emended it to emmë, emya. (VT48:4) In its basic sense, (a)milyë would be a variant of amil, amillë "mother", q.v.
	ammalë noun "yellow bird, 'yellow hammer' " (SMAL)
	ammat- vb. “devour” (PE18:85)
	ammë noun "mother" (AM1)
	amna adv. “nearer to (to a further point in the motion) towards an object” (PE17:91). Also ambena.
	#amorta- vb. "heave"  (literally "up-rise, rise up", cf. orta-; the prefix am- means "up"). Only attested as a participle amortala "heaving" in Markirya.
	ampa noun "hook", also name of tengwa #14 (GAP, Appendix E, VT47:20)
	ampano noun "building" (especially of wood), "wooden hall" (PAN; alternative form umpano, VT45:36, which Tolkien in one case altered to ampano, VT46:8). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, ampano was also the name of tengwa #6 (VT46:8), which letter Tolkien would later call umbar instead (changing its value from mp to mb).
	ampenda adj. "uphill". Also ambapenda. (AM2)
	ampendë noun "upward slope" (PEN/PÉNED)
	amu adv. "up, upwards" (LT2:335; in Tolkien's later Quenya amba)
	amu- vb. "raise" (LT2:335; LotR-style Quenya has orta-)
	amun (amund-) noun "hill" (LT2:335; in Tolkien's later Quenya ambo)
	amuntë noun "sunrise" (LT2:335; Tolkien's later Quenya has anarórë)
	amya (1) noun “my mother”, form used in address (PE17:170), cf. emya
	amya- (2) evidently a prefix corresponding to mai- (q.v.) in meaning (PE17:163, 172)
	an (1) conj. and prep. "for" (Nam, RGEO:66), an cé mo quernë… “for if one turned…” (VT49:8), also used adverbially in the formula an + a noun to express “one more” (of the thing concerned: an quetta “a word more”, PE17:91). The an of the phrase es sorni heruion an! "the Eagles of the Lords are at hand" (SD:290) however seems to denote motion towards (the speaker): the Eagles are coming. Etym has an, ana "to, towards" (NĀ1). The phrase an i falmalī (PE17:127) is not clearly translated but seems to be a paraphrase of the word falmalinnar “upon the foaming waves” (Nam), suggesting that an can be used as a paraphrase of the allative ending (and if falmalī is seen as a Book Quenya accusative form because of the long final vowel, this is evidence that an governs the accusative case).  In the "Arctic" sentence, an is translated "until". Regarding an as used in Namárië, various sources indicate that it means an “moreover, further(more), to proceed” (VT49:18-19) or (“properly”) “further, plus, in addition” (PE17:69, 90). According to one late source (ca. 1966 or later), an “is very frequently used after a ‘full stop’, when an account or description is confirmed after a pause. So in Galadriel’s Elvish lament […]: An sí Tintallë, etc. [= For now the Kindler, etc…] This is translated by me ‘for’, side an is (as here) often in fact used when the additional matter provides an explanation of or reason for what has already been said”. Related is the use of an + noun to express “one more”; here an is presumably accented, something the word would not normally be when used as a conjunction or preposition.
	an- (2) intensive or superlative prefix carrying the idea of "very" or "most", seen in ancalima "most bright" (cf. calima "bright"), antara "very high, very lofty" and #anyára *"very old" or *"oldest" (the latter form occurring in the so-called Elaine inscription [VT49:40], there with the dative ending -n). Assimilated to am- before p-, as in amparca ("k") "very dry", and to al-, ar-, as- before words in l-, r-, s- (though Tolkien seems to indicate that before words in l- derived from earlier d, the original quality of the consonant would be preserved so that forms in and- rather than all- would result). See also un-. (Letters:279, VT45:5, 36) Regarding the form of the superlative prefix before certain consonants, another, partially discrepant system was also set down in the Etymologies and first published in VT45:36. The prefix was to appear as um- or un- before labialized consonants like p-, qu-, v- (the consonant v preserving its ancient pronunciation b- following the prefix, thus producing a word in umb-), as in- (technically iñ-) before c- and g- (the latter presumably referring to words that originally had initial g-, later lost in Quenya but evidently preserved following this prefix), and as an- otherwise. However, this system would contradict the canonical example ancalima, which would have been *incalima if Tolkien had maintained this idea. – In a post-LotR source, the basic form of the prefix is given as am- instead (see am- #2). In this late conception, the prefix still appears as an- before most consonants, but as ama- before r, l, and the form an- is used even before s- (whether original or from þ), not the assimilated variant as- described above. General principles would suggest that the form am- should also appear before y- (so the form #anyára probably presupposes an- rather than am- as the basic form of the prefix, Tolkien revisiting the earlier concept in the Elaine inscription). (PE17:92)
	an- (3) prefix "re" in antúlien, q.v. (LotR-style Quenya shows en- instead.)
ana (1) prep. “to” (VT49:35), “as preposition ana is used when purely dative formula is required” (PE17:147), perhaps meaning that the preposition ana can be used instead of the dative ending -n (#1, q.v.) Also as prefix: ana- "to, towards" (NĀ1); an (q.v.) is used with this meaning in one source (PE17:127)
	ana (2) vb., apparently the imperative "give!", but Tolkien rewrote the text in question (VT44:13). See anta #1.
	anaië vb. “has been”; see ná #1.
	Anamo noun in genitive "of doom" in Rithil-Anamo "Ring of Doom" (q.v.) Since the reference is to a place (a circle) where judgement was passed, this seems to be "doom" in the sense of "juridical decision" or "(legal) justice". The nominative "doom" may be *anan, with stem anam- (since the root would be NAM as in nam- "to judge", námo noun "judge"). Alternatively, but less probably, the nominative may be *anama.
	#anan (anam-), reconstructed nominative of Anamo, q.v.
	ananta, a-nanta conj. "and yet, but yet" (FS, NDAN)
	Anar noun "Sun" (ANÁR, NAR1, SA:nár; UT:22 cf. 51); anar "a sun" (Markirya); Anarinya "my Sun" (FS). See also ceuranar, Úr-anar. (According to VT45:6, Tolkien in the Etymologies mentioned anar "sun" as the name of the short vowel carrier of the Tengwar writing system; it would be the first letter if anar is written in Quenya mode Tengwar.) Compounded in the masc. name Anárion *"Sun-son" (Isildur's brother, also the Númenorean king Tar-Anárion, UT:210); also in Anardil *"Sun-friend" (Appendix A), a name also occurring in the form Anardilya with a suffix of endearment (UT:174, 418). Anarya noun second day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Sun (Appendix D). Anarríma name of a constellation: *"Sun-border"??? (Silm; cf. ríma)
	#anarcandë noun "petition" (isolated from anarcandemman, "our petitions", possibly an error for *anarcandemmar) (VT44:8); Tolkien seems to have abandoned this word in favour of #arcandë, q.v.
	anat conj. "but" (VT43:23; possibly an ephemeral form)
	anarórë noun "sunrise" (ORO)
	anca noun "jaws, row of teeth" (ÁNAK [there spelt anca in Etym as printed in LR, but according to VT45:5, Tolkien's own spelling in the Etym manuscript was anka], NAK [there spelt anka], Appendix E, SA - despite what Christopher Tolkien says in the entry anca in SA, the Quenya word anca as such does NOT appear in the Sindarin dragon-name Ancalagon, but its Sindarin cognate anc does. See ÁNAK in the Etymologies.) Also name of tengwa #15 (Appendix E). Despite its English gloss, anca is a singular word (in Etym the gloss is indeed "jaw", not "jaws").
	Ancalë noun ("k") "radiant one" or "radiance" = Sun (KAL, VT45:5, 18). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, Ancalë was the name of letter #7 (VT45:18), which tengwa Tolkien would later call anga instead – changing its Quenya value from nc to ng. - Another source (VT45:36) cites the word for "radiance, Sun" as incalë ("k"), but the form Ancalë is probably to be preferred.
	ancalima adj. "most bright, brightest", sc. calima "bright" with a superlative or intensive prefix (LotR2:IV ch. 9; see Letters:385 for translation). Ancalima imbi eleni "brightest among stars", also [ancalima] imb' illi "brightest among all" (VT47:30). Fem. name Ancalimë, *"Most Bright One", also masc. Ancalimon (Appendix A). Tar-Ancalimë, a Númenorean Queen (UT:210)
anda adj. "long" (ÁNAD/ANDA), “far” (PE17:90). In Andafangar noun "Longbeards", one of the tribes of the Dwarves (= Khuzdul Sigin-tarâg and Sindarin Anfangrim) (PM:320). Compare Andafalassë, #andamacil, andamunda, andanéya, andatehta, Anduinë. – Apparently derived from the adj. anda is andavë "long" as adverb (“at great length”, PE17:102), suggesting that the ending -vë can be used to derive adverbs from adjectives (LotR3:VI ch. 4, translated in Letters:308)
Andafalassë place-name “Langstrand” (long shore/beach) (PE17:135)
#andamacil noun “long sword” (anda + macil), attested with the possessive ending -wa (andamacilwa, PE17:147)
	andamunda noun "elephant" ("long-mouth", anda + munda) (MBUD)
	andanéya adv. “long ago, once upon a time” (also anda né) (VT49:31)
	andatehta noun "long-mark" (TEK, PE17:123), indicated to be an accent-like symbol ´ used to mark long vowels (VT46:17). Compare anda, tehta. 
	andavë adv. "long, at great length" (PE17:102); see anda
	ando (1) noun "gate", also name of tengwa #5 (AD, Appendix E). A deleted entry in the Etymologies gave Ando Lómen, evidently "Door of Night" (VT45:28; notice "Qenya" genitive in -n rather than -o as in LotR-style Quenya)
	ando (2) adv. "long"; maybe replaced by andavë; see anda (VT14:5)
	-ando masculine agentive suffix, deleted in the Etymologies (VT45:16), but occurring in words Tolkien used later, like #runando "redeemer".
	Andolat place-name (name of a hill; = S Dolad) (NDOL)
	andon noun "great gate" (andond-, as in pl. andondi) (AD)
	Andórë noun full form of Andor, "land of gift", name of Númenor (SD:247)
	andú-, nú- “going down, setting (of sun), west” (PE17:18), element underlying words like the following, and also núna (q.v.) 
	andúna adj. “western” (PE17:18)
	andúnë noun "sunset, west, evening" (NDŪ, Markirya, SA), also in Namárië: Andúnë "West" (but the standard Quenya translation of "west" is Númen) (Nam, RGEO:66) Cf. andu- in Andúnië, Andúril.
	Anduinë place-name = Sindarin Anduin, Long River (PE17:40)
	Andúnië (apparently a variant form of andúnë) place-name, a city and port on the western coast of Númenor, said to mean "sunset". (Appendix A, Silm, UT:166, NDŪ/VT45:38)
	Andúril noun "Flame of the West", sword-name (LotR1:II ch. 3)
	Andustar place-name, the "Westlands" of Númenor (UT:165)
	†ánë, see anta-
	#ane-, form of copula “was” when pronominal endings follow: anen “I was”, anel “you were”, anes “(s)he/it was” (VT49:28, 29); see ná #1.
	anel noun “daughter” (PE17:170), possibly intended by Tolkien as a replacement for seldë (q.v.). Compare anon.
	anessë noun "given (or added) name" (encompassing both epessi and amilessi) (MR:217)
	anga noun "iron", also name of tengwa #7 (ANGĀ, Appendix E, SA, PM:347, LT1:249, 268). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, anga was the name of letter #19, which tengwa Tolkien would later call noldo instead (VT45:6). Masc. names Angamaitë "Iron-handed" (Letters:347), Angaráto "Iron-champion", Sindarin Angrod (SA:ar(a) ). See also Angamando, tornanga and cf. Angainor as the name of the chain with which Melkor was bound (Silm)
	angaina adj. "of iron" (ANGĀ)
	angaitya noun "torment" (LT1:249); rather nwalmë in Tolkien's later Quenya
	Angamando place-name "Iron-gaol", Sindarin Angband (MR:350). The Etymologies gives Angamanda "Angband, Hell", lit. "Iron-prison" (MBAD, VT45:33). In deleted material in the Etymologies, the Quenya name of Angband was Angavanda (VT45:6); cf. vanda #2. Older "Qenya" has Angamandu "Hells of Iron" (or pl. Angamandi) (LT1:249).
	angayanda adj. “miserable” (QL:34)
	angayassë noun "misery" (LT1:249, QL:34)
	ango noun "snake"; stem angu- as in angulócë (q.v.); pl. angwi (ANGWA/ANGU)
	angulócë noun ("k") "dragon" (LOK)
	ánië, see anta-
	anna noun "gift" (ANA1, SA), “a thing handed, brought or sent to a person” (PE17:125), also name of tengwa #23 (Appendix E); pl. annar "gifts" in Fíriel's Song. Masc. name Annatar "Lord of Gifts, *Gift-lord", name assumed by Sauron when he tried to seduce the Eldar in the Second Age (SA:tar). Eruanna noun "God-gift", gift of God, i.e. "grace" (VT43:38)
	anni > arni prep. with pron. suffix *”beside me” (VT49:25); see ara
	aññol- (sic, read angol-?) noun "strong smell" (VT45:5, cf. ÑOL)
	anon noun “son” (PE17:170), possibly intended by Tolkien as a replacement for yondo. 
	anqualë noun "agony, death" (form Tolkien seems to have intended as a replacement for unqualë of similar meaning, VT45:24, 36)
	anta- (1) vb. "give" (ANA1, MC:215, 221), pa.t. antanë (antanen “I gave”, VT49:14) or †ánë, perfect ánië (PE17:147, cf. QL:31). According to VT49:14, Tolkien noted that anta- was sometimes often with an “ironic tone” to refer to missiles, so that antanen hatal sena “I gave him a spear (as a present)” was often used with the real sense of “I cast a spear at him”. Usually the recipient of the thing given is mentioned in the dative or allative case (like sena in this example), but there is also a construction similar to English “present someone with something” in which the recipient is the object and the gift appears in the instrumental case: antanenyes parmanen, “I presented him with a book” (PE17:91). – The verb occurs several times in FS: antalto "they gave"; strangely, no past tense marker seems to be present (see -lto for the ending); antar a pl. verb translated "they gave", though in LotR-style Quenya it would rather be the present tense "give" (pl.); antaróta "he gave it" (anta-ró-ta "gave-he-it"), another verb occurring in Fíriel's Song, once again with no past tense marker. Also antáva "will give", future tense of anta- "give"; read perhaps *antuva in LotR-style Quenya; similarly antaváro "he will give" (LR:63) might later have appeared as *antuvas (with the ending -s rather than “Qenya” -ro for “he”). Antalë imperative "give thou" (VT43:17), sc. anta "give" + the element le "thou", but this was a form Tolkien abandoned. Apparently ana was at one point considered as another imperative “give”, but Tolkien rewrote the text in question (VT44:13), and the normal patterns would suggest *á anta with an independent imperative particle.
	anta (2) noun "face" (ANA1, VT45:5). Cf. cendelë.
	antara adj. "very high, very lofty", the adjective tára "lofty" with the superlative prefix an- (q.v.) We might have expected *antára. Also place-name Antaro (VT45:5, 36), said to be the "name of a mountain in Valinor south of Taniq[u]etil" (VT46:17)
	antë noun "giver" (f.) (ANA1)
	[antil noun "middle finger" (VT47:26)]
	anto (1) noun "mouth", also name of tengwa #13 (Appendix E)
	anto (2) noun "giver" (masc.) (ANA1)
antoryamë noun "strengthening", used of various manipulations of a stem, such as lengthening vowels or consonants or turning a consonant or a vowel into a "blend" (see ostimë) (VT39:9)
	antúlien vb. "hath returned" in the phrase I.cal' antúlien ("k") "Light hath returned" (LT1:270); note the "Qenya" third person ending -n. In LotR-style Quenya this would perhaps read *i cál' enutúlië or *i cala enutúlië.
	#anyára (attested with dative ending: anyáran), see an-, yára
	anwa adj. "real, actual, true" (ANA2)
	†anwë (1) vb. archaic past tense of auta-, q.v. (WJ:366)
anwë (2)  prep. with pron. suffix *”beside us”, changed to armë (VT49:25); see ara. 
anwet prep. with pron. suffix *”beside us” (dual), changed to armet (VT49:25); see ara.
	#ap- (cited in the form apë, evidently the 3rd person aorist) vb. "touch (one)" in the figurative sense; "concern, affect" (VT44:26)
	apa (1) prep. "after" (VT44:36), attested as a prefix in apacenyë and Apanónar, q.v. Variant ep- in epessë, q.v.; see epë for futher discussion. (According to VT44:36, apa was glossed “after” and also “before” in one late manuscript, but both meanings were rejected.) See also apa # 2 below. For Neo-Quenya purposes, apa should probably be ascribed the meaning "after", as in our most widely-published sources (compare Apanónar, “the After-born”, as a name of Men in the Silmarillion). Variants pa, pá (VT44:36), but like apa these are also ascribed other meanings elsewhere; see separate entry. Apo (VT44:36) may be yet another variant of the word for "after".
	apa (2) prep. denoting "on" with reference to contact of surfaces, especially vertical surface (in the sense in which a picture hangs on a wall). Apa is said to have this meaning in various Tolkien manuscripts (VT44:26), but apa is also used for "after" (see apa #1 above), and the two were probably never meant to coexist in a single variant of Quenya. The clash may be avoided by consistently using the variants pá, pa (q.v.) mentioned by Tolkien in the sense of apa #2. Another variant gives apa, pá “on (above but touching)” (VT49:18).
	apa (3) conj. “but”: melinyes apa la hé “I love him but not him” (another) (VT49:15)
	apacenyë is translated "foresight" in MR:216; yet the context and the form of the word itself clearly indicates that it is not a noun but actually the pl. form of an adjective *apacenya "of foresight". The noun "foresight" is almost certainly *apacen; cf. tercen "insight". (MR:216) The literal meaning of *apacen is *"aftersight", sc. knowledge of that which comes after. [Essi] apacenyë "[names] of foresight", prophetic names given to a child by its mother (MR:216)
apairë noun "victory" (GL:17)
	Apanónar noun "the After-born", an Elvish name of Mortal Men as the Second-born of Ilúvatar (WJ:387)
	aparuivë, also just ruivë, noun “wild fire, “fire as conflagration” (PE17:183)
	apo prep. ?"after" (see apa #1) (VT44:36)
	appa- vb. "touch" (in the literal sense; contrast #ap-, q.v.) (VT44:26)
	apsa noun "cooked food, meat" (AP)
apsene- vb. "remit, release, forgive" (VT43:18, 20; it is unclear whether the final -e is somehow part of the verbal stem or is just the final form of the ending -i associated with the aorist, so that "I forgive" would be *apsenin). Where Tolkien used apsene-, he cited the person(s) forgiven in the dative (ámen apsenë "forgive us", literally "for us"), whereas the matter that is forgiven appears as a direct object (VT43:12). Compare avatyar-.
	aqua adv. "fully, completely, altogether, wholly" (WJ:392)
aquapahtië noun "privacy" (literally *"fully-closedness", of a mind that closes itself against telepathic transfers) (VT39:23)
[aquet noun? vb? ”answer” (PE17:166)]
	ar (1) conj. "and" (AR2, SA, FS, Nam, RGEO:67, CO, LR:47, 56, MC:216, VT43:31, VT44:10, 34; see VT47:31 for etymology, cf. also VT49:25, 40). The older form of the conjunction was az (PE17:41). Ar is often assimilated to al, as before l, s (PE17:41, 71), but “in written Quenya ar was usually written in all cases” (PE17:71). In one case, Tolkien altered the phrase ar larmar “and raiments” to al larmar; the former may then be seen as representing the spelling, whereas the latter represents the pronunciation (PE17:175). More complex schemes of assimilation are suggested to have existed in “Old Quenya”, the conjunction varying between ar, a and as depending on the following consonant (PE17:41, 71). An alternative longer form of the conjunction, arë, is said to occur "occasionally in Tolkien's later writings" (VT43:31, cf. VT48:14). In the Etymologies, the word for "and" was first written as ar(a) (VT45:6). – In one source, Tolkien notes that Quenya used ar “as preposition beside, next, or as adverb = and” (PE17:145); compare ara.
	ar (2) noun "day" (PE17:148), apparently short for árë,  occurring in the names of the Valinorean week listed below. Tolkien indicated that ar in these names could also be arë when the following element begins in a consonant (VT45:27). Usually the word for "day" in LotR-style Quenya is rather aurë (or ré), q.v.
	Ar Fanturion noun *"Day of the Fanturi (Mandos and Lorien)" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK). Also Arë Fanturion (VT45:27).
	Ar Manwen noun *"Day of Manwe" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK; this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n.) Also Arë Manwen (VT45:27).
	Ar Ulmon noun *"Day of Ulmo" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK; this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n.)
	Ar Veruen noun *"Day of the Spouses" (Aule and Yavanna) (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK; this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n.) Also Arë Veruen (VT45:27).
ar- (1) prefix "outside" (AR2), element meaning "beside" (VT42:17), “by” (PE17:169; in the same source the glosses “near, by, beside” were rejected). Cf. ara.
ar- (2), also ari-, prefix for superlative (compare arya #1, 2), hence arcalima “brightest”, arimelda *”dearest” (PE17:56-57). In the grammar described in the source, this prefix was to express superlative as the highest degree (in actual comparison), whereas the alternative prefix an- rather expressed “very” or “exceedingly” with a more purely augmentative or adverbial force, but these distinctions do not seem to have been clearly present at all stages of Tolkien’s work. See an- #2, am- #2. 
	ára noun "dawn" (AR1). According to VT45:6, ára is also the name of the long vowel carrier of the Tengwar system; it would be the first letter of the word ára if spelt in Tengwar.
	ara prep.(and adv.?) "outside, beside, besides" (AR2, VT49:57). According to VT45:6, the original glosses were "without, outside, beside", but Tolkien emended this. Arsë “he is out”, VT49:23, 35, 36. As for ar(a), see ar #1. – VT49:25 lists what seems to be ar(a) combined with various pronominal suffixes: Singular anni > arni *”beside me”, astyë *“beside you” (informal), allë *“besides you” (formal), arsë *”beside him/her”, plural anwë > armë *“beside us” (exclusive), arwë *“beside us” (inclusive), astë > ardë *“beside you” (plural), astë > artë *“beside them”; dual anwet > armet *“beside us (two)”. (Here Tolkien presupposes that ara represents original ada-.) The same source lists the unglossed forms ari, arin that may combine the preposition with the article, hence *“beside the” (VT49:24-25)
	Ara-, ar- a prefixed form of the stem Ara- "noble" (PM:344). In the masc. names Aracáno "high chieftain", mothername (amilessë, q.v.) of Fingolfin (PM:360, cf. 344), Arafinwë "Finarfin" (MR:230)
	Araman place-name "outside Aman", name of a region (SA:ar, mān)
	aran noun "king"; pl. arani (WJ:369, VT45:16, PE17:186); gen.pl. aranion "of kings" in asëa aranion, q.v.; aranya *"my king" (aran + nya) (UT:193). Aran Meletyalda "king your mighty" = "your majesty" (WJ:369); aran Ondórëo, “a king of Gondor” (VT49:27). Also in arandil "king's friend, royalist", arandur "king's servant, minister" (Letters:386); Arantar masc. name, *"King-Lord" (Appendix A); Arandor "Kingsland" region in Númenor (UT:165); the long form Arandórë appears as a name of Arnor in PE17:28 (elsewhere Arnanórë, q.v.) Other compounds ingaran, Noldóran, Núaran, q.v.
	aranel noun "princess" (likely *aranell-) (UT:434)
	#aranië noun "kingdom" (aranielya "thy kingdom") (VT43:15). Cf. #aranyë in Ardaranyë “the Kingdom of Arda” (PE17:105)
	aranus (#aranuss-), also aranussë, noun “kingship” (PE17:155)
	Aranwë masc. name *"Kingly Person" (Silm); Aranwion patronymic "son of Aranwë" (UT:50 cf. 32)
	aranya, also ranya, adj. "free". Another gloss was not certainly legible, but the editors suggest "uncontrolling" (VT46:10)
	#aranyë noun “kingdom”, isolated from Ardaranyë “the Kingdom of Arda” (PE17:105)
	Aratan masc. name *"Noble Adan" (Silm)
	arata adj. “high, lofty, noble” (PE17:49, 186). Also used as a a noun with nominal pl. form Aratar "the Supreme", the chief Valar, translation of the foreign word Máhani adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:402). Aratarya "her sublimity"; Varda Aratarya "Varda the lofty, Varda in her sublimity" (WJ:369). In one source, Aratar is translated as a singular: “High One” (PE17:186)
	arato noun “a noble” (PE17:147), in PE17:118 given as aratō and there glossed “lord” (often = “king”). Cf. aráto. The form cited in the latter source, aratō with a long final vowel, is evidently very archaic (compare Enderō under Ender); later the vowel would become short. (PE17:118)
	aráto noun "champion, eminent man" (SA:ar(a) )
	arauca ("k") adj. "swift, rushing" (LT2:347). Compare arauco.
	arauco ("k") noun "a powerful, hostile, and terrible creature; demon" (variant of rauco). Tolkien's earlier "Qenya" has araucë "demon" (WJ:415, LT1:250)
	arca (1) adj. “narrow” (AK)
	arca- (2) vb. "pray" (VT43:23, cf. VT44:8, 18); evidently this basically means "to petition" or “to ask for”, compare arcandë below.
	#arcandë noun "petition" (isolated from arcandemmar "our petitions") (VT44:8)
	Arciryas masc. name (evidently derived from *arcirya "royal ship") (Appendix A)
	arda noun "realm" (GAR under 3AR). It is said that arda, when used as a common noun, "meant any more or less bounded or defined place, a region" (WJ:402), or "a particular land or region" (WJ:413).  Capitalized Arda "the Realm", name of the Earth as the kingdom of Manwë (Silm), "the name given to our world or earth...within the immensity of Eä" (Letters:283, there again rendered “realm”), “our planet” (MR:39), once translated "Earth" (SD:246). In a wider sense, Arda can refer to the entire Solar System (MR:337). Also name of tengwa #26 (Appendix E). Masc. name Ardamírë "Jewel of the World" (PM:348), shorter form Ardamir (UT:210); Ardaranyë “the Kingdom of Arda” (PE17:105)
	ardë prep. with pron. suffix *”beside you” (pl), changed from astë (VT49:25). See ara.
	arë conj. "and", longer form of ar, q.v. (VT43:31)
	árë noun "day" (PM:127) or "sunlight" (SA:arien). Stem ári- (PE17:126, where the word is further defined as “warmth, especially of the sun, sunlight”).  Also name of tengwa #31; cf. also ar # 2. Originally pronounced ázë; when /z/ merged with /r/, the letter became superfluous and was given the new value ss, hence it was re-named essë (Appendix E). Also árë nuquerna *"árë reversed", name of tengwa #32, similar to normal árë but turned upside down (Appendix E). See also ilyázëa, ilyárëa under ilya. – In the Etymologies, this word has a short initial vowel: arë pl. ari (AR1)
	Arfanyaras, Arfanyarassë place-name, a "variant or close equivalent" of Taniquetil (WJ:403)
	arië noun "daytime" (AR1)   
	Arien fem. name "the Sun-maiden", the Maia of the Sun (AR1; Silm); cf. árë "sunlight"
	ari, arin prep. *”beside the”? See ara.
	arimaitë adj. “skillful” (PE17:162)
	arin noun "morning" (AR1)
	arinya adj. "morning" in the adjectival sense (e.g. *arinya árë "morning sun") and hence "early" (AR1, VT45:6)
	arma (1) noun “a ray of sunlight” (PE17:148)
	[arma (2) noun "possessions, goods, property" (VT45:14), "a piece of goods or property" (VT45:16)]
	armar noun "goods" (pl.) (3AR). Compare the sg. arma "a piece of goods or property" mentioned above, though Tolkien struck out that text.
	armaro noun "neighbour"; also asambar, asambaro (VT48:20, VT49:25)
armë  prep. with pron. suffix *”beside us” (exclusive), changed from anwë (VT49:25); see ara. 
armet prep. with pron. suffix *”beside us” (dual), changed from arwet (VT49:25); see ara.
	Armenelos place-name, City of the Kings in Númenor (ar-menel-os(to) "royal-heaven-city"???) The stem should possibly be *Armenelost- (compare Mandos, Mandost-). 
	#arna, see Arnanórë
	Arnanórë, Arnanor place-name "Arnor", Royal Land (so #arna = "royal"?) (Letters:428). Cf. Arandórë. 
	arni < anni prep. with pron. suffix *”beside me” (VT49:25); see ara
	arpo noun “thief” (PE19:89)
	arquen noun "a noble" (WJ:372), “knight” (PE17:147)
	arsë prep. with pron. suffix *”beside him/her” (informal) (VT49:25); see ara. Arsë “he is out” (VT49:23, 35, 36)
	arta (1) adj. "exalted, lofty" (PM:354), “high, noble” (PE17:118, 147); cf. names like Artaher, Artanis.
	arta (2) noun "fort, fortress" (GARAT under 3AR)
	arta (3) adv. ”etcetera” (PE17:71); see ta #4. 
	arta (4) prep. "across, athwart" (LT2:335), perhaps rather olla in Tolkien’s later Quenya.
	Artaher (Artahér-) masc. name "noble lord" (Sindarin Arothir) (PM:346)
	Artamir masc. name *"Noble jewel" (Appendix A); cf. mírë. 
	Artanis fem. name ”noble woman” (PM:347)

	Arvalin place-name, "outside Valinor" (AR2)
	Arvernien place-name, “(the land) beside the Verna” (PE17:19). It is unclear what “Verna” refers to.
	Arveruen noun third day of the Valinorian week of 5 days, dedicated to Aule and Yavanna (BES)
	arwa (1) adj. "in control of, possessing" (followed by genitive, e.g. *arwa collo, "having a cloak [colla]"). Also suffix -arwa "having", as in aldarwa "having trees, tree-grown" (3AR). In a deleted entry in the Etymologies, -arwa was glossed "having, possessing, holding, controlling" (VT45:14)
	[arwa (2) noun "possessions, belongings, wealth (VT45:14)]
arwë (1)  prep. with pron. suffix *”beside us” (inclusive) (VT49:25); see ara. 
	[arwë (2) noun "possessions, wealth; treasure" (VT45:14, 16)]
	arya (1) adj. “excelling”, used as the comparative form of mára “good”, hence *“better” (PE17:57). The superlative (*“best”) is i arya with the article, with genitive to express *“the best of…” Cf. mára.
	arya- (2) vb. “to excel” (PE17:56). Cf. #1 above.
	arya (3) noun "twelve hours, day" (AR1; compare aurë). In deleted notes this word was also used as an adjective: "of the day, light" (VT45:6). Still according to VT45:6, arya is also the name of Tengwa #26 in the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, but Tolkien would later call #26 arda instead (indeed arya was changed from arda in the source; Tolkien would later change his mind back again). The abandoned name arya suggests that the letter was to have the value ry (rather than rd as in the classical system outlined in LotR Appendix E). – Since the word for “day” (daylight period) is given as aurë in later sources, and arya is assigned other meanings in late material (see #1, 2 above), the conceptual validity of arya “day” is questionable.%
	[arya- (4) vb. "to possess" (VT45:14)]
	Aryantë noun "Daybringer" (AR1, ANA1)
	aryon noun "heir" (GAR under 3AR). In a deleted entry in the Etymologies, the word was given as aryo, aryon and defined as "son of property = heir" (VT45:14), whereas in VT45:16 (reproducing deleted material from the Etymologies), the word is defined as "heir, prince". Alternative form haryon.
	as prep. "with" (together with), also attested with a pronominal suffix: aselyë "with thee" (VT47:31, VT43:29). The conjunction ar “and” may also appear in assimilated form as before s; see ar #1. 
asa (þ) prefix denoting easiness in doing, cf. asalastë. The prefix often appears in reduced form as- before p, t, c, q, s (PE17:148), cf. ascenë.
	asalastë (*aþa-) adj. “easily heard” (PE17:148)
	asambar, asambaro noun "neighbour"; also armaro (VT48:20). Since the ending -o is associated with the masculine gender, the form asambar may be gender-neutral whereas the other forms are gender-marked as masculine.
	[asanótë] (þ) ?adj. (not glossed, perhaps *”easily counted” (PE17:172)
	asar (þ) (Vanyarin athar) noun "fixed time, festival". Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399) Pl. asari is attested (VT39:31)
ascenë, ascénima (þ) adj. “visible, easily seen” (PE17:148)
	asëa (þ) 1) adj. “beneficial, helpful, kindly” (so according to a late note where the word is derived from *ATHAYA); hence also: 2) asëa (þ) noun, name of the healing plant called in Sindarin athelas (PE17:148), in English (representing Westron) called “kingsfoil”, cf. longer Quenya name asëa aranion (þ) "asëa of kings" (LotR3:V ch. 8). Cf. aran.
	asië (þ) noun “ease, comfort” (PE17:148)
	#ascat- vb. "break asunder", only attested in the past tense: ascantë (SD:310)
	assa "hole, perforation, opening, mouth" (GAS)
	assari noun "bones" (?) (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	asya- (þ) vb. “to ease, assist, comfort” (PE17:148)
	asta (1) noun "month", a division of the year (VT42:20). Pl. astar is attested (Appendix D). According to VT48:11, the basic meaning of asta is "division, a part", especially one of other equal parts: "of the year, a month or period". According to VT48:19, asta is also used in Quenya as a group suffix (see quentasta).
	asta- (2) vb. “to heat, bake (by exposure to sun)” (PE17:148)
	astar noun “faith, loyalty (not belief)” (PE17:183). Not to be confused with the pl. form of asta #1.
	astarindo noun “bystander” (one standing beside another as a supporter) (PE17:71). Also artarindo.
	astarmo noun “bystander”, mainly used in the sense of “witness” (PE17:71)
astë prep. with pron. suffix (1) *”beside you”, in this sense changed to ardë; (2) *”beside them”, in this sense changed to artë (VT49:25). See ara. 
	Astaldo noun "the Valiant", a title of Tulkas (Silm, MR:438); replaced Poldórëa.
	asto noun "dust" (ÁS-AT). According to VT45:6, asto was the name of tengwa #13 in the pre-classical system presupposed in the Etymologies, but Tolkien would later change the name of this letter to anto (its Quenya value changing from st to nt).
	astyë prep. with pron. suffix *”beside you” (informal) (VT49:25); see ara
	ata adv. "again", also prefix ata-, at- "back, again, re-; second time, double" (AT(AT), PE17:166, cf. ataquanta-, ataquetië) or “two” (PE17:166), also “ambi-“ as in ataformaitë, q.v.
ataformaitë adj. “ambidextrous” (VT49:9, 10, 42), pl. ataformaiti (VT49:9, 11). Spelling was changed from attaformaitë in one case (VT49:9). Cf. #ataformo.
#ataformo (pl. ataformor is attested), noun “ambidexter”. Spelling changed from attaformor. Cf. adj. ataformaitë (VT49:9, 32)
	F
	atalantë noun "downfall, overthrow, especially as name [Atalantë] of the [downfallen] land of Númenor" (DAT/DANT, TALÁT, Akallabêth, SD:247, 310; also LR:47, VT45:26). Variant atalantië "Downfall", said to be a normal noun-formation in Quenya (Letters:347, footnote). From the common noun atalantë "collapse, downfall" is derived the adj. atalantëa "ruinous, downfallen", pl. atalantië in Markirya (changed to sg. atalantëa – this change does not make immediate sense, since the adjective undoubtedly modifies a plural noun, but Tolkien does not always let adjectives agree in number).
	atalantëa adj. "ruinous, downfallen"; see atalantë
	atamaitë adj. “two-handed” (PE17:162)
	atalta- vb. "collapse, fall in" (TALÁT), weak pa.t. ataltanë "down-fell, fell down" in LR:47 and SD:247, but strong past tense atalantë "down-fell" in LR:56
	Atan pl. Atani noun "the Second Folk", an Elvish name of Mortal Men, the Second-born of Ilúvatar. Cf. also Núnatani (WJ:386), Hróatani (PE17:18), q.v. Atanalcar masc. name, *"Man-glory" (UT:210, cf. alcar). Atanamir masc.name, *"Edain-jewel"? (Appendix A). Atanatar masc. name, "Father of Men" (Appendix A), also common noun atanatar, pl. Atanatári, "Fathers of Men", a title that "properly belonged only to the leaders and chieftains of the peoples at the time of their entry into Beleriand" (PM:324, SA:atar)
	ataquanta- vb. “refall, fall second time, double fall” (sic in PE17:166). The correct gloss must be “refill, fill second time, double fill”, which would connect with the verb quanta- “fill” and also make rather better sense. 
	ataquë ("q") noun "construction, building" (TAK)
	ataquetië noun (or gerund of verb) “saying again, repetition” (PE17:166). Cited as at(a)quetië, implying an alternative form atquetië. 
	atar noun "father" (SA; WJ:402, UT:193, LT1:255, VT43:37, VT44:12). According to the Etymologies (ATA) the pl. is atari, but contrast #atári in Atanatári "Fathers of Men" (q.v.); possibly the word behaves differently when compounded. Atarinya "my father" (LR:70), atar(inya) the form a child would use addressing his or her father, also reduced to atya (VT47:26). Diminutive masc. name Atarincë ("k") "Little father", amilessë (never used in narrative) of Curufinwë = Curufin (PM:353). Átaremma, Ataremma "our Father" as the first word of the Quenya translation of the Lord's Prayer, written before Tolkien changed -mm- as the marker of 1st person pl. exclusive to -lm-; notice -e- as a connecting vowel before the ending -mma "our". In some versions of the Lord's Prayer, including the final version, the initial a of atar "father" is lengthened, producing #átar. This may be a contraction of *a atar "o Father", or the vowel may be lengthened to give special emphasis to #Átar "Father" as a religious title (VT43:13). However, in VT44:12 Atar is also a vocative form referring to God, and yet the initial vowel remains short.
	atarmë dative (?) pron. "for us" (VT44:18; Tolkien apparently considered dropping this curious form, which in another text was replaced by rá men, rámen; see rá #1)
	ataryo, also taryo (cited as (a)taryo), noun "daddy", also used as a name for the thumb in children's play, but Tolkien emended it to atto/atya (VT48:4). Compare atar "father".
atatya vb? adj.? "double" (VT42:26)
	atendëa noun "double-middle", name of the two enderi or middle-days that occurred in leap-years according to the calendar of Imladris (Appendix D, first edition of LotR)
atsa noun "catch, hook, claw" (GAT)
	atta (1) cardinal "two" (AT(AT), Letters:427, VT42:26, 27, VT48:6, 19). Elen atta “two stars” (VT49:44); notice how a noun is indeclinable before this numeral, and any case endings are “singular” and added to the numeral rather than the noun, e.g. genitive elen atto “of two stars” (VT49:45). Attalyar "Bipeds" (sg. *Attalya) = Petty-dwarves (from Sindarin Tad-dail) (WJ:389).  – A word atta "again" was struck out; see the entry TAT in Etym and cf. ata in this list.
	[atta- (prefix) (2) "back again, re-" (TAT)] 
	[atta, (3) variant of atto (VT48:19). The dual form attat was retained.]
	atta (ata-) (4) prep. “across, over, lying from side to side” (VT49:32; it is not quite clear whether this is a Quenya word or not)
	attaformaitë, see ataformaitë 
	#attaformo, see #ataformo
	attalaitë adj. “biped” (having two feet) (VT49:42, PE12:88)
attëa ordinal "second", replacing the archaic form tatya (VT42:25)
	atto noun "father, daddy" (hypocoristic) (ATA, LR:49), supposedly a word in "actual 'family' use" (VT47:26), also used in children's play for "thumb" and "big toe" (VT47:10, 26, VT48:4, 6). The dual form attat listed in VT48:19 seems to be formed from the alternative form atta, though attat was changed by Tolkien from attot. -  Compare atya.
	atquetië, see ataquetië
	#atya (1) adj. "second" in Atyarussa "Second russa" (VT41:10)
	atya (2) noun "daddy", supposedly a word in "actual 'family' use" (VT47:26, PE17:170), also used in children's play for "thumb" and "big toe" (VT47:10, 26, VT48:4, 6); reduction of at(an)ya "my father" (or, as explained in VT48:19, reduction of at-nya of similar meaning). Compare atto.
	atwa adj. "double" (AT(AT) )
	au- (1) a verbal prefix "off, *away", as in auciri ("k") "cut off" (so as to get rid of or lose a portion); contrast hóciri (WJ:366, 368). Compare au as a variant of the stem awa “away from” (VT49:24) and the adverb au (see #2 below).
	au (2) adv. “away”, of position rather than movement (compare oa). –PE17:148
	au- (3) privative prefix, = "without" (AWA)
	aulë (1) noun "invention" (GAWA/GOWO); evidently connected to or associated with Aulë, name of the Vala of craft (GAWA/GOWO, TAN), spouse of Yavanna; the name is adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:399)
aulë (2) adj. "shaggy" (LT1:249; this "Qenya" word may have been obsoleted by # 1 above)
Aulendil masc. name *"Friend of Aulë" (UT:210)
Aulendur masc. name "Servant of Aulë", applied especially to those persons, or families, among the Noldor who actually entered Aulë's service and in return received instruction from him (PM:366)
Aulëonnar (sg. #Aulëonna) noun "Children of Aulë", a name of the Dwarves (PM:391). See onna.
	aurë noun "sunlight, day" (SA:ur), “day (of light), a day of special meaning or festival” (VT49:45). locative auressë "in (the) morning" in Markirya, allative aurenna *”on the day” (VT49:43-45). Also compare amaurëa.
	Aurel (Aureld-, e.g. pl. Aureldi) noun "Elf who departed from Beleriand to Aman" (while the Sindar stayed there) (WJ:363). Also Oarel, q.v. Earlier Auzel.
ausa (þ) noun "a dim shape, spectral or vague apparition" (VT42:10, cf. 9). Compare fairë. 
	ausië noun "wealth" (LT2:336; rather lar or alma in Tolkien’s later Quenya)
	auta- (1) vb. "go away, leave" (leave the point of the speaker's thought); old "strong" past tense anwë, usually replaced by vánë, perfect avánië – but when the meaning is purely physical "went away (to another place)" rather than "disappear", the past tense oantë, perfect oantië was used. Past participle vanwa "gone, lost, no longer to be had, vanished, departed, dead, past and over" (WJ:366)
	auta- (2) vb. "invent, originate, devise" (GAWA/GOWO) This could be obsoleted by # 1 above; on the other hand, the verbs would be quite distinct in the past tense, where auta- #2 would likely have the straightforward form *autanë.
	autë noun "prosperity, wealth", also adj. "rich" (LT2:336; rather alma, and as adj. alya or lárëa, in Tolkien’s later Quenya)
	Auzel pl. Auzeldi noun Vanyarin form (and original form) of Aureldi (WJ:374); see Aurel
	#av- vb. "depart" (cited in the form avin "he departs", read "I depart" in LotR-style Quenya), pa.t. ambë (QL:33). The word may perhaps be used to translate "leave" with a direct object, since "depart" is at least vaguely transitive in English.
	áva, avá (the latter stressed on the final syllable) "Don't!", negative imperative particle (compare ala, #ála). Cf. ávan "I won't" (also ván, ványë); áva carë! ("k") "don't do it!" (WJ:371)
	ava (1) adv.? noun? prep.? "outside, beyond" (AWA, VT45:6)
	ava- (2) prefix indicating something forbidden: avaquétima "not to be said, that must not be said", avanyárima "not to be told or related" (WJ:370)
ava- (3) prefix "without" (AR2, AWA). In some cases apparently used as a mere negation prefix: The form avalerya in VT41:6 is seemingly a negated form of the verb lerya- "release, set free"; the verb avalerya- is suggested to have the same meaning as the root KHAP = "bind, make fast, restrain, deprive of liberty". Likewise, the verb avalatya- from the same source seems to mean "to close, shut", this being a negated form of a verb *latya- "open" (q.v.)
	ava- (4) vb with pa.t. avanë. This verb is not clearly glossed; apparently meaning refuse or prohibit (WJ:370). Cf. áva, Avamanyar. What is seems to be more or less the same verb has its principal tenses listed (with the ending -n “I”) in VT49:13: aorist avan, present ávan (ávëan), future auvan for older avuvan, past avanen or auvan, perfect avávien. In one version of the paradigm, the present tense ávëan and past avanen are marked as archaic/poetic forms. One text seemingly uses the pa.t. aunë in the sense “was not”, as a negative verb, but this may have been a short-lived idea of Tolkien’s (the text was revised).
	Avacúma place-name, "Exterior Void beyond the World" (AWA, (OY) )
	avahaira adj. "remote, far" (KHAYA)
	Avallónë place-name; haven and city on Tol Eressëa. In the Akallabêth the city is said to be so named because it is "of all cities the nearest to Valinor", but the etymology is not further explained. The Etymologies gives Avalóna "the outer isle" = Tol Eressëa (LONO, (AWA), VT45:28)
	Avamanyar noun Elves that refused to go to Aman (= Avari) (WJ:370). Sg. Avamanya (PE17:143)
	avánië, pl. avánier, perfect tense of auta-, q.v. (WJ:366)
avanir noun "unwill" (VT39:23)
	avanótë adj. "without number, numberless" (AWA, AR2, VT49:36)
	avanwa adj. “refused, forbidden, banned” (PE17:143), blended in meaning with vanwa, q.v.
avanyárima adj. "not to be told or related" (WJ:370), “unspeakable, wahat one must not tell” (PE17:143)
	avaquet- ("q") vb. "refuse, forbid" (KWET)
	avaquétima adj. "not to be said, that must not be said" (WJ:370)	
avar noun "recusant, one who refuses to act as advised or commanded"; pl. Avari Elves that refused to join in the westward march to Aman (WJ:371, singular Avar in WJ:377 and VT47:13, 24). The Etymologies gives Avar or Avaro, pl. Avari  "Elves who never left Middle-earth or began the march" (AB/ABAR)
Avathar place-name denoting the land between the southern Pelóri and the Sea, where Ungoliant dwelt; said to be "not Elvish" in WJ:404 and must be thought of as an adaptation from Valarin; on the other hand, MR:284 states that it is "ancient Quenya" and offers the interpretation "The Shadows". Whatever the case, it must have become *Avasar in Exilic Quenya.
#avatyar- vb. "forgive" (VT43:18); the form ávatyara (VT43:10) seems to include the imperative particle á (the two-word phrase *á avatyara "forgive!" merging into ávatyara). Plural aorist avatyarir (VT43:20).  Where Tolkien used avatyar-, he cited the person(s) forgiven in the ablative (ávatyara mello "forgive us", literally "from us"), whereas the matter that is forgiven appears as a direct object (VT43:11). Compare apsenë.
	avestalis noun "January" (LT1:252; LotR-style Quenya has Narvinyë)
	awalda adj. “move[d], stirred, exited” (PE17:189); perhaps archaic Quenya for later *oalda.
	axa ("ks") (1) noun "narrow path, ravine" (AK)
	axa ("ks") (2) noun "waterfall" (LT1:249, 255 - this "Qenya" word may have been obsoleted by # 1 above) 
	axan noun "law, rule, commandment". Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399) Pl. axani is attested (VT39:23, defined as "laws, rules, as primarily proceeding from Eru" in VT39:30). Apparently compounded in the name Axantur *"Commandment-lord" (= lord who respects and/or rules in accordance with God-given commandments?) (UT:210)
	axë (“ks”) noun “neck” (the bony part of the neck, not including throat), pl. axi given. Also sg. acas (the alternative form axë is said to be “later” and seems to be an analogical back-formation from the pl. axi). The word is also used geographically of rock ridges. (PE17:92)
	axo noun "bone"; pl. axor in Markirya
	áya noun "awe" (PM:363)
	áyan (later form aian) noun “a holy thing or object or place” (PE17:149)
	az, archaic form of the conjunction ar “and”; see ar #1. 
	ázë see árë

<C>
ca, cata, cana prep? "behind, at back of place" (VT43:30)	
cá ("kâ") "jaw" noun (GL:37; later sources give anca)
caila ("k") adj. (and noun???) "lying in bed, bedridden, sickness" (KAY, VT45:19). It may be that the gloss "sickness" applies only to the "Noldorin"/Sindarin form cael listed before Quenya caila, since cael could be both an adjective and a noun (the ancient adjective *kailā "bedridden" merging with the noun *kailē "sickness"). In Quenya the form caila < *kailā would probably be an adjective only.
	caima ("k") noun "bed" (KAY)
	caimasan ("k") noun "bedchamber" (caimasamb-, as in pl. caimasambi) (STAB)
	caimassë ("k") noun "lying in bed, sickness" (KAY) 
	caimassëa ("k") adj. "bedridden, sick" (KAY)
	[caina, see cëa, cëan]
	cainë "lay", pa.t. of caita- "lie", q.v.
	[cainen] ("k") cardinal "ten" (KAYAN/KAYAR). According to VT48:12, Tolkien eventually rejected this word (cainen would only mean "I lay", sc. the pa.t. cainë with the ending -n "I"). See quain, quëan.
	cairë ("k") vb. "lay" (pa.t. of "lie") (MC:221; this is "Qenya" - in LotR-style Quenya cainë pa.t. of caita?) An word cairë with no clear definition appears in PE17:101; see cëa, cairë. 
	[caista] ("k"), fraction "one tenth" (1/10), also cast, an unusual Quenya form since the language does not normally tolerate two consonants finally (VT48:11). Compound caistanótië ("k") "decimal system" (in counting) (ibid.) However, Tolkien later rejected the root KAYAN "ten" in favour of KWAYA(M), changing the cardinal "ten" from cainen to quain, quëan (VT48:13). Apparently we must therefore read *quaista as the new fraction "one tenth".
	caita- vb. "lie" (= lie down, not "tell something untrue"), aorist tense "lies" in the sentences sindanóriello caita mornië "out of a grey land darkness lies" (Nam, RGEO:67), caitas lá/palla i sír “it is [lit. lies] (far) beyond the river” (PE17:65); the latter example demonstrates that caita can also be used of a geographical feature that “lies” in a certain place. According to PE17:72 and VT48:12-13, the pa.t. is cainë or cëantë rather than **caitanë. The "Qenya" form kakainen, translated "were lying", may seem to be related (VT27:7, 21)
	caivo ("k") noun "corpse" (MC:221; Tolkien's later Quenya has loico or quelet)
	caivo-calma ("k") noun "corpse-light" = corpsecandle (MC:214; this is "Qenya": Tolkien's later Quenya has loicolícuma)
	#cal- vb. "shine", future tense caluva ("k") "shall shine" (UT:22 cf. 51). Compare also early "Qenya" cala- ("k") "shine" (LT1:254). It is possible that the verbal stem should have a final -a in later Quenya as well, since this vowel would not appear in the future tense caluva (compare valuvar as the pl. future tense of vala-, WJ:404).
	cala ("k") noun "light" (KAL). Concerning the "Qenya" verb cala-, see #cal- above.
	Calacilya ("k") place-name "Pass of Light", in which Kôr was built (KIL, KAL). Evidently a variant of Calacirya.
	Calacirya place-name "Light-cleft", Calacirya, the great ravine in the mountains of Valinor, the passage leading from Valmar to the region where the Teleri lived. Genitive Calaciryo in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67)
	Calaciryan ("k") place-name "the Cleft of Light", the pass in the Pelóri, apparently a variant of Calacirya (WJ:403, SA:kal-, kir-). Calaciryan, Calaciryandë, "the region of Eldamar (Elvenhome) in and near the entrance to the ravine, where the Light was brighter and the land more beautiful" (RGEO:70)
	Calainis ("k") noun "May" (LT1:252, 254; in Tolkien's later Quenya Lótessë)
	Calamando ("k") masc. name "Light Mando" = Manwë (MBAD, (KAL, MANAD), VT45:18, 33)
	calambar (“k”) adj.? *”light-fated” (VT49:41, 42)
	Calamor ("k") (Q? - not Sindarin!) pl. noun  *"Light-Ones" = Light-Elves? Sg. *Calamo (KAL)
calassë ("k") noun "clarity, brilliance" (GL:39)
	Calaquendi pl. noun "Elves of the Light, Light-elves" (SA:kal-, SA:quen-/quet-, WJ:361, WJ:373); spelt Kalaqendi in Etym (KAL). Sg. *Calaquendë.
	calar noun "lamp" (VT47:13)
	calarus (calarust-) noun "polished copper" (VT41:10)
	Calavénë ("k") noun "Sun" (lit. *"light-vessel", *"light-dish") (LT1:254)
	Calaventë ("k") noun "Sun" (LT1:254)
	calca noun "glass" (VT47:35); compare hyellë, cilin.
	cálë ("k") noun "light" (Markirya; in early "Qenya", cálë meant "morning", LT1:254)
	calima adj. "bright" (VT42:32); cf. ancalima; in PE17:56, arcalima appears as another superlative “brightest” (see ar- #2).
	Calimehtar masc.name, *"Bright Swordsman" (Appendix A)
	Calimmacil masc. name, *"Bright Sword" (for *Calimamacil?) (Appendix A)
	calina ("k") adj. "light" (KAL), "bright" (VT42:32) “(literally illumined) sunny, light” (PE17:153)– but apparently a noun "light" in coacalina, q.v.
	Calion, Tar-Calion, masc. name, the Quenya name of King Ar-Pharazôn "the Golden". Calion would seem to be connected to cal- "shine", cálë "light". (Silm)
	Caliondo, masc. name, maybe a longer form of Calion above (unless Caliondo contains ondo "rock") (UT:210)
	calliérë pa.t. vb. "shone" ("k") (MC:220; this is "Qenya" - in LotR-style Quenya *callë, *caltanë.)
	callo ("k") noun "noble man, hero" (KAL)
	calma noun "lamp, a light, device for shining light” (Appendix E, KAL, PE17:123, 180), also name of tengwa #3 (cf. calmatéma), which was also already its name in the mostly pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies (VT45:18, there spelt "kalma"). In early "Qenya", calma ("k") meant "daylight" (LT1:254; in MC:213, the word is translated "light"). Plural instrumental calmainen ("k") "lights-by", by lights (MC:216)
	Calmacil masc. name, *"Light-sword" or possibly (if haplology of *Calmamacil) *"Lamp-sword" (Appendix A). Cf. cálë, cala, calma, macil.
	calmatan noun “lampwright” (PE17:96)
	calmatéma noun "k-series", velar series: the third column of the Tengwar system (Appendix E)
	calpa ("k") (1) noun "water-vessel" (KALPA), "bucket, vessel" (QL:47)
calpa- ("k") (2) vb. "draw water, scoop out, bale out" (KALPA)
	calta- ("k") vb. "shine" (KAL)
	calwa ("k") adj. "beautiful" (LT1:254)
	calya- ("k") vb. "illuminate" (KAL, VT45:18)
	#cam- vb. "receive" (attested in the past tense #camnë with pronominal endings added: camnelyes "you received it") (VT47:21)
	cáma noun “guilt, responsibility” (QL:43)
	camba noun "the whole hand, but as flexed, with fingers more or less closed, cupped, in the attitude of receiving or holding" (VT47:7)
	cambë noun ("k") "hollow (of hand)" (KAB). In the deleted first version of the entry KAB, this word was glossed "closed hand" (VT45:18). Cambeya (“k”) colloquial Quenya for “his hand” (the formally correct form being *camberya) (VT49:17)
	camta- ("k") vb. "to (make) fit; to fit, accommodate" (VT44:14; the cluster mt seems unusual for Quenya, and it is not explicitly stated in the source that this is a Quenya word. Cf. PE17:91, where mt is shown to become nt in Quenya words.)
	can- (1) (prefix) ("k") "four" (KÁNAT)
	*can- (2) vb. "command, order" (give an order) or (with things as object) "demand" (PM:361-362; where various derivatives of the stem KAN- are listed; the verb *can- is not directly cited, but seems implied by the statement "in Quenya the sense command had become the usual one". The undefined verb canya- listed elsewhere [PE17:113] may also be taken as the actual verbal derivative that Tolkien here refers to.)
	cana, see ca
	Canafinwë masc. name "strong-voiced or ?commanding Finwë"; his Sindarin name was Maglor (see Macalaurë). Short Quenya name Cáno. (PM:352)
	canaquë ("k, kw") cardinal "fourteen" (VT48:21).The spelling "kanakwe" occurring in the primary source could suggest that this is really a Common Eldarin form; if so, one could theorize that the Quenya form would be *canquë with syncope of the middle vowel (the same source lists "minikwe" as a word for 11, and the Quenya form is known to be minque rather than **miniquë). On the other hand, in the same source "tolokwe" as a word for 18 is listed together with definite Quenya forms and is apparently an unorthodox spelling of *toloquë (as observed by the editor): Here no syncope producing *tolquë occurs.
	canasta ("k") fraction "one fourth" (1/4). Also cansat, casta (VT48:11)
	cánë ("k") noun "valour" (KAN)
	cáno ("k") noun "commander", usually as the title of a lesser chief, especially one acting as the deputy of one higher in rank (PM:345, SA:káno – PM:362 indicates that cáno originially meant "crier, herald"); "ruler, governor, chieftain" (UT:400), “leader” (PE17:113). Masc. name Cáno, see Canafinwë. The word cáno ("k") also occurred in the Etymologies with the gloss "chief", but Tolkien changed it to cánë "valour" (VT45:19).
	cansat ("k") fraction "one fourth" (1/4). Also canasta, casta (VT48:11)
canta (1) ("k") cardinal "four" (KÁNAT, VT42:24, VT48:6). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, this word was cited with a final hyphen (as if it were a verb), but the hyphen does not actually appear in Tolkien's manuscript (VT45:19). Ordinal cantëa ("k") "fourth" (VT42:25) Compare cantil.
	canta (2) ("k") noun “shape” (PE17:175), also used as adj. "shaped", also as quasi-suffix -canta ("k") "-shaped" (KAT)
	canta- (3) an undefined verb (?) cited in PE17:113. See canya- #2. 
cantëa ("k") ordinal "fourth" (VT42:25)
[cantil ("k") noun "fourth finger" (VT47:26)]
	canuva ("k") "leaden" (LT1:268; if this "Qenya" word is used in a LotR-style Quenya context, it must not be confused with the future tense of can-)
	canwa (1) noun "announcement, order" (PM:362)
	#canwa (2) noun “face”, isolated from canwarya (“k”) *”his face”, evidently an ephemeral form Tolkien abandoned in favour of cendelë, q.v. (VT49:21; see VT49:34 regarding uncertainties as to the manuscript reading)
	*canwë, see #caw- 
	canya (1) ("k") adj. "bold" (KAN). 
	canya- (2) verb (pa.t. canyanë given), undefined form occurring in PE17:113 (together with the seeming variant canta-). See *can- #2 for a conjecture regarding its meaning.
	cap- (“k”) vb. “jump, leap”, pa.t. campë (QL:45, PE16:134)
	capta- (“k”) vb. “startle”, pa.t. cápë (QL:45)
	capalinda ("k") noun "spring of water" (LT1:257; ehtelë may be preferred in LotR-style Quenya)
	cár (cas-) ("k") noun "head" (KAS). The given stem-form appears doubtful within the phonological framework of LotR-style Quenya. Probably we should read cas with stem car- (PE14:69 indeed reads “kas ‘head’, pl. kari”, and VT49:17 quotes the sg. “kas” from a post-LotR source). Compare other forms found in late sources: hlas “ear” with stem hlar- (PE17:62) and olos “dream”, pl. olori (UT:396). In Tolkien’s early “Qenya”, post-vocalic -s became -r at the end of words but was preserved when another vowel followed. His later scheme either lets -r appear in both positions, or reverses the scenario altogether (hence olos, olor-). It would seem that the forms cár, cas- were distractedly carried over into the Etymologies from the Qenya Lexicon (kar, kas-, QL:45) even though they presuppose an earlier version of the phonology. An apparent variant form in late material, cára from earlier cáza (“k”), however fits the later phonology since intervocalic s would become z > r (PE17:188). 
	car- (1) vb. "make, do, build, form" (1st pers. aorist carin "I make, build"; the aorist is listed with all pronominal endings in VT49:16, also in pl. and dual forms carir, carit). Regarding the form carize- (PE17:128), see -s #1. Pa.t. carnë (KAR, PE17:74, 144). The infinitival aorist stem carë ("k") (by Patrick Wynne called a “general aorist infinitive” in VT49:34) occurs in ecë nin carë sa “I can do it” (VT49:34), also in áva carë "don't do it" (WJ:371) and uin carë (PE17:68); in the last example Tolkien calls carë an example of the “simplest aorist infinitive”, the same source referring to carië as the “general infinitive” of the same verb. Pl. aorist carir "form" in the phrase i carir quettar (“k”) "those who form words" (WJ:391, cf. VT49:16), continuative cára, future caruva (PE17:144), carita ("k"), infinitive/gerund "to do" or "doing" (VT42:33), with suffixes caritas "to do it" or "doing it", caritalya(s) "your doing (it)" in VT41:13,17, VT42:33. Past participle #carna, q.v.; VT43:15 also gives the long form carina ("k"), read perhaps *cárina. (Carima as a passive participle may be a mistake, VT43:15.) PE17:68 refers to a “simple past passive participle” of the form carinwa (“kari-nwa”). “Rare” past participle active (?) cárienwa (“k”) *”having done” (PE17:68), unless this is also a kind of passive participle (the wording of the source is unclear). Some alternative forms in Fíriel's Song: past tense cárë ("káre") "made"; this may still be an alternative to the better-attested form carnë (LR:362) even in LotR-style Quenya. Cf. ohtacárë “war-made”, made war (see #ohtacar-). Also *cárië with various suffixes: cárier ("kárier") is translated "they made"; in LotR-style Quenya this could be seen as an augmentless perfect, hence *"they have made", "they" being simply the plural ending -r. The literal meaning of cárielto ("k") must also be *"they made" (cf. -lto). – Derived adjectives urcárima and urcarnë “hard to make / do”, urucarin “made with difficulty” (PE17:154), saucarya “evil-doing” (PE17:68).
	#car- (2) prep. "with" (carelyë "with thee"), prepositional element (evidently an ephemeral form abandoned by Tolkien) (VT43:29)
	car (card-) (3) ("k") noun "deed" (rewritten >) "building, house" (KAR). Cf. carda.
	carampë, pa.t. of carpa-, q.v.
	carassë noun “a built fort or dwelling surrounded by bulwarks” (PE17:84)
	carasta- vb. “build” (PE17:84)
	cari pl. noun “heads”; see cár
	caraxë ("k, ks") noun "jagged hedge of spikes"; compare Helcaraxë (KARAK)
	carca noun "tooth" (KARAK) or "fang" (SA:carak-). In a deleted version of the entry in question, the glosses were "tooth, spike, peak" (VT45:19). When referring to a normal tooth, not necessarily sharp, the word nelet is probably to be preferred. – Cf. also pl. carcar ("karkar") in Markirya, there translated "rocks", evidently referring to sharp rocks. Already the early "Qenya Lexicon" has carca ("k") "fang, tooth, tusk" (LT2:344). Collective carcanë, q.v.
	carcanë ("k") noun "row of teeth" (KARAK; this may be a misreading for *carcarë). In early "Qenya", carcanë meant "snarling", adj. (MC:213)
	carcaras, carcassë ("k") noun "row of spikes or teeth" (LT2:344 - Tolkien's later Quenya has carcanë [read ?carcarë], but these words, especially carcassë, may still be valid)
	[carco ("k") noun "crow" (KARKA)] (Changed by Tolkien to corco.)
	carda noun “deed” (PE17:51). Cf. car #3. The word may contain the ending -da (q.v.) denoting the result of the corresponding verbal action.
	carma (1) noun “tool, weapon” (PE17:114)
	carma (2) noun "helm" (helmet) in Carma-cundo ("k") "Helm-guardian" (PM:260). Notice that in PE17:114, Tolkien indicated that he rather wanted carma to mean “tool” or “weapon”, leaving the status of carma “helmet” uncertain. Possibly shortened to -car in the names Eldacar (Elfhelm?), Hallacar (Tall-helm?) Cf. also cassa in Etym.
	Carmë ("k") noun "art" (UT:459); used = “structure” in sundocarmë (“k”) “Base-structure”, q.v. under sundo.
	carna passive participle *"built, made" in Vincarna "newly-made" (MR:408), also struck-out alacarna “well-done, well-made” (PE17:172). Carna would seem to be the passive participle of car-, though a longer form carina (read *cárina?) is also attested (VT43:15).
	carnë adj. "red", “scarlet, red” (SA:caran, PE17:154, MC:214, KARÁN - spelt with a k in the two latter sources), not to be confused with the past tense of car- "do, make". Stem carni- as in Carnimírië, Carnistir.
	carneambarai ("k") "red-???" (Narqelion; very early "Qenya")
	carnevaitë ("k") noun "red sky" (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	carnevalinar ("k") "red-???" (Narqelion; very early "Qenya")
	Carnil ("k") name of a star (or planet), identified with Mars (MR:435)
	†carni-mírëa adj. “red-jewelled” (PE17:83), whence the name Carnimírië "[one] having red gems, Red-jewelled", the rowan-tree in Quickbeam's song (LotR2:III ch. 4, SA:caran, PE17:83), also translated "with adornment of red jewels" (Letters:224; where the reading "carnemírie" occurs)
	Carnistir masc. name "red-face", mother-name (never used in narrative) of Morifinwë = Caranthir (PM:353)
	[cáro] ("k") noun "doer, actor, agent" (KAR; replaced by tyaro). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the accent of the word cáro was omitted (VT45:19).
	carpa (“k”) (1) noun “mouth”, including lips, teeth, tongue etc. (PE17:126); also used for “language”, in particular the phonetic system. Cf. náva and páva.
	carpa- (“k”) (2) intransitive vb. “talk, speak, use tongue” (pa.t. carampë given). (PE17:126)
carpassë (“k”) noun ”mouth-system”, i.e. ”full organized language, including system, vocabulary, metre etc.” (PE17:126); probably replaced by pahta (2), q.v.
carrëa  (for cas-raya) noun "tressure" (net for confining the hair). (VT42:12)
#carva noun "womb" (isolated from carvalyo "of thy womb") (VT43:31; Tolkien seems to have abandoned this form in favour of #móna, q.v.)
cas (“k”) “head” (VT49:17), cf. also deleted [cas] ("k") noun "top, summit" (VT45:19). This noun should evidently have the stem-form car-. See cár.
	Casar ("k") noun "Dwarf", pl. Casari or Casári, partitive plural Casalli. Adapted from Dwarvish Khazâd. Casarrondo place-name "Khazad-dûm", Moria (WJ:388, 389; pl. Casári also in WJ:402)
	cassa ("k") noun "helmet" (KAS; though spelt cassa also in the Etymologies as printed in LR, VT45:19 indicates that Tolkien's own spelling was kassa). Cf. carma in a later source.
	[cast] ("k"), fraction "one tenth", but the form is apparently obsolete; see caista. (VT48:11)
	casta (1) ("k") fraction "one fourth" (1/4). Also canasta, cansat (VT48:11)
	casta (2) noun "cause" (reason) (QL:43)
	Castamir masc. name, "casta[?]-jewel" (Appendix A)
	castol noun “helmet”, synonyms tholon (q.v.), sól (q.v), also variant castolo (“k”) (PE17:186, 188)
	cata, see ca
	cauca ("k") adj. "crooked" (LT1:257; cf. #caw-)
	cauco ("k") noun "humpback" (LT1:257)
cauma (”k”) noun ”protection or shelter natural or otherwise, sc. against sun, or rain, or wind – or against darts; shield” (PE17:108)
	caurë ("k") noun "fear" (LT1:257)
	caurëa ("k") adj. "timid" (LT1:257)
	cautáron ("k") adj.? "bent" (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	*cav-, see #caw-
	#caw- vb. "bow" ("k") (1st pers aorist cawin "I bow") (LT1:257; cf. cauca, cauco). In Tolkien's later Quenya, a verbal stem with w in this position does not seem to fit the general phonology well; intervocalic w would become v. We should perhaps read *cav- whereever the second consonant of the root follows a vowel, but the nasal-infixed past tense could be *canwë with the original quality of the consonant preserved. (Compare such a past tense form as anwë, q.v.) However, Tolkien’s later verb luhta- may be preferred for intransitive “bow”.
	[-cca (“k”) ?“your”, apparently an abandoned 2nd person plural or dual possessive (VT49:49). Compare -lca.]
	cé ("k"), also ce (“k”) “may be” (VT49:19, 27), particle indicating uncertainty (VT42:34; ce in Bill Welden's note is a misspelling, VT44:38, but the short form ce does occur in other texts, cf. VT49:18-19). In VT42, Welden wrote that Tolkien altered ké to kwí (or kwíta, q.v.), but Welden later noted that "it does not follow that because the form was changed in another sentence it would necessarily have been corrected in the examples cited" (VT44:38). So cé/ké may still be a conceptually valid form. (The forms in kw- rather than qu- seem abnormal for Quenya, at least as far as spelling is concerned.) In another conceptual phase, cé was also used = “if” (VT49:19), but this conjunction appears as qui elsewhere. Examples of cé, ce meaning “if” (said to be “usually [used] with aorist”) include cé mo quetë ulca (“k”, “q”) *”if one speaks evil”, cé tulis, nauvan tanomë (“k”) *”if (s)he comes, I will be there” (VT49:19), cé mo… *“if one…”, ce formenna *“if northwards” (VT49:26)
	[cëa, cëan ("k") cardinal "ten", forms Tolkien later abandoned in favour of quain or quëan. An adjectival form caina ("k") was also listed, but must likewise be considered obsolete. (VT48:12-13, VT49:54)]
cëa (k”), cairë noun ?“fence” (PE17:101); or numeral “ten”? The source is obscure; cf. cëa above.
	cectelë ("k") noun "fountain" (LT1:257, LT2:338. In LotR-style Quenya rather ehtelë.)
	Celec-orna noun “Swift-tall”, Quenya form of Celegorn (PE17:112)
	celma ("k") noun "channel" (KEL)
	celu ("k") noun "stream" (LT1:257; rather celumë in LotR-style Quenya) 
	celumë ("k") noun "stream, flow" (KEL, LT1:257); locative pl. celumessen ("k") in Markirya (ëar-celumessen is translated "in the flowing sea", lit. *"in sea-streams").
	celusindi ("k") noun "river" (LT1:257; hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya, where the terms sírë and sirya appear instead)
	celussë ("k") noun "freshet, water falling out swiftly from a rocky spring" (UT:426, VT49:30)
	celvar (sg. #celva) ("k") noun "animals, living things that move" (Silm)
	cemen (cén) (spelt "kemen" in some sources, "cemen" in others) noun "earth" (VT44:34), Cemenyë ("k") "and Earth" (VT47:11). Cemen refers to the earth as a flat floor beneath menel, the heavens (SA:kemen); "soil, earth" (KEM, LT1:257). At one stage, Tolkien intended cemen to be the genitive of cén; later cemen became the nominative, and the status of cén is uncertain. See Kementári. Locative cemessë, cemenzë (really spelt with c rather than k in one version, but also kemenze) in the Quenya Lord's Prayer; later changed to kemendë, cemendë (VT43:17)
	[cemenáro, see cemnaro]
	Cemendur masc. name *"Earth-servant" (i.e. farmer?) (Appendix A, UT:210)
	cemi noun "earth, soil, land"; Cémi ("k") "Mother Earth" (LT1:257; the "Qenya" word cemi would correspond to cemen in LotR-style Quenya)
	**cemina ("k"), see cemna
	cemna ("k") adj. "of earth, earthen" (In Etym as printed in LR:363 s.v. KEM, this word is cited as cemina, but according to VT45:19 Tolkien's manuscript actually reads cemna.)
	cemnaro ("k") noun "potter" (TAN). First written as cemenáro (VT45:19).
	cén (cem-) ("k") noun "soil, earth"; see cemen (KEM)
	cen- ("k") vb. "see, behold", future tense cenuva ("kenuva") "shall see" in Markirya. Imperative cena ("k"), VT47:31. Also #cen = noun "sight" as the final element of some nouns (*apacen, tercen, q.v.) Compare the root KHEN-, KEN-, KYEN- "look at, see, observe, direct gaze" (VT45:21)
	cenai (“k”) conj. “if it be that” (VT49:19). This word presupposes ce = “if”; other sources rather make qui the word for “if”, whereas ce or cé is used = “maybe”.
	cenasit, canasta (“k”) adv. “if it be so, may be, perhaps” (VT49:19). Compare cenai. 
	cenda- vb. "watch" (not "guard", but observe to gain information), also used = "read". Cenda = also noun "reading", as in sanwecenda "thought-inspection, thought-reading". (VT41:5, PE17:156)
	cendë noun ”point” (PE16:96)
	cendelë noun “face” (VT49:21)
	cenima (“k”) adj. “visible” (PE17:175); cf. cen- “see”. Read possibly *cénima; see -ima and cf. hraicénima “scarcely visible” (PE17:154).
	centa noun "communication, enquiry, *essay"; Ósanwë-centa ("k") "Communication of Thought", an appendix to Pengolodh's Lammas or "Account of Tongues" (VT39:23, MR:415); cf. also essecenta, q.v.
	centano ("k") noun "potter" (TAN, VT45:19)
	Cermië noun seventh month of the year, "July" (Appendix D)
	certa noun "rune" (pl. certar given), adapted from Sindarin certh (a "true" or inherited Quenya form of primitive ¤kirtē would have been *cirtë, but this word did not occur). (WJ:396) 
ces- (Þ) (“k”), “to search (for something), to examine (something) in order to find (something)”; the root meaning is given as “enquire of, question, examine” (something). Cesë parma “to look in a book” (for a passage or information required); here the aorist stem cesë is used as infinitive. Notice that ces- here takes a simple direct object parma (not locative *parmassë, despite the translation). Past tense cense (Þ) given, replacing the phonologically expected form centë (also cited). (PE17:156) 
	cesta- (“k”) vb. “to seek, search for” (PE17:156)
	ceula, see quëa
	ceulë (k), probably noun *"renewal" (VT48:8)
	ceura ("k"), probably adj. "renewed" (VT48:8). Also in the form ceurë (VT48:7), but ceura seems to be the form that would fit Tolkien's general principles best: there are many adjectives in -ra, whereas forms in -rë would normally be taken to be the plural form of such adjectives. 
	ceuran- ("k") noun "new moon" (compare Rána "moon"). The word is cited with a final hyphen, as if some final element is missing, but Rána could very well be reduced to -ran at the end of a compound. (VT48:7) 
	ceuranar ("k") noun "new sun after solstice" (VT48:7), apparently a compound ceura or ceurë + anar, q.v.
	ceurë ("k") adj. "renewed" (emended from a noun ceura "renewal") (VT48:7). See ceura and compare ceuranar.
	ceuta- ("k") vb. "renew, refresh" (VT48:7, 8)
	céva ("k") adj. "fresh, new" (VT48:7, 8)
	cildë ("k") pa.t. vb.? *"saw" (???) The phrase úri kilde hísen níe nienaite is translated "the Sun with wet eyes dropped tears of mist", literally perhaps something like *"the Sun saw (through) misty tears tearfully"??? (MC:221; this is "Qenya"; cf. cildo)
	cildo ("k") vb. "one saw" (MC:220; this is "Qenya"; cf. cildë, ciluva)
	cilin noun “glass” (“often used as in English (“often used as in English for any thing or implement made of glass”) (PE17:37). Compare calca, hyellë.
	cilintilla or cilintír noun “looking-glass” (i.e. mirror?) (PE17:37)
	cilinyul noun “drinking-vessel” (made of glass) (PE17:37)
	#cilmë noun "choosing" (isolated from Essecilmë "name-choosing", q.v.) (MR:214); also in #cilmessë pl. cilmessi ("k") "self-names", literally names of personal choice (PM:339) (cilmë + essi, hence *"choice-names").
	ciluva ("k") vb. "shall see" (MC:213, 214; this is "Qenya")
	cilya noun "chasm", allative cilyanna ("k") "in-Chasm" (sc. "into [the] chasm") (LR:47, 56). In MR:471, cilya is defined as "cleft, gorge". Spelt kilya in Etym, there defined as "cleft, pass between hills, gorge" (KIL)
cim- vb. "heed" (GL:39)
	cinta adj. “small” (PE17:157)
#cir-, see círa
	círa ("k") vb. "sail" (apparently the continuative stem of #cir-) (Markirya)
	circa ("k") noun "sickle" (KIRIK)
	círier ("k") pa.t. vb. "clove" (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	cirinci ("k"), sg. *cirincë, noun: a species of birds, "no bigger than wrens, but all scarlet, with piping voices on the edge of human hearing" (UT:169). The word seems to incorporate the diminutive ending -incë.
	ciris ("k") noun "cleft, crack" (LT2:337 - obsoleted by cirissë?)
	cirissë ("k") noun "slash, gash" (KIRIS; the glosses "cleft" and maybe ?"crevasse" occurred in deleted material, VT45:23)
	*cirtë see certa
	cirya ("k") noun "ship" (MC:213, 214, 220, 221), "(sharp-prowed) ship" (SA:kir-, where the word is misspelt círya with a long í; Christopher Tolkien probably confused it with the first element of the Sindarin name Círdan. It seems that Círyon, the name of Isildur's son, is likewise misspelt; read Ciryon as in the index and the main text of the Silmarillion. Cf. also kirya in Etym, stem KIR.) Also in Markirya. In the Plotz letter, cirya is inflected for all cases except plural possessive (*ciryaiva). The curious dual form ciriat occurs in Letters:427, whereas Plotz gives the expected form ciryat. Locative ciryasse "upon a ship" (MC:216). Compounded in ciryaquen "shipman, sailor" (WJ:372), also ciryando (PE17:58), cf. also ciryamo “mariner” (UT:8). Masc. names Ciryaher *"Ship-lord" (Appendix A), Ciryandil *"Ship-friend" (Appendix A), Ciryatan *"Ship-builder" (Appendix A), also Tar-Ciryatan, name of a Númenórean king, "King Shipbuilder" (SA:kir-)
	ciryamo noun "mariner", nominative and genitive are identical since the noun already ends in -o, cf. Indis i-Ciryamo "the Mariner's Wife" (UT:8)
	ciryando (“k”) noun “sailor” (PE17:58).
	ciryaquen (“k”) “shipman, sailor” (WJ:372)
	#cíta- (“k”) vb. “suppose”, cited in the 1st pers. aorist: cítan “I suppose” (VT49:19)
	coa ("köa") noun "house" (VT47:35, with etymology); coarya "his house" (WJ:369), allative coaryanna (“k”) “to/at his house” (VT49:23, 35), quenderinwë coar (“koar”) “Elvish bodies” (PE17:175). Notice how coa “house” is here used metaphorically = “body”, as also in the compound coacalina "light of the house" (a metaphor for the soul [fëa] dwelling inside the body [hroa]) (MR:250)
coi ("k") "life" (LT1:257; in Tolkien's later Quenya cuilë)
	[coacë, see quácë]
	coimas noun "life-bread" = Sindarin lembas (SA:cuivië, PM:395); coimas Eldaron "the coimas of the Eldar" (PM:395)
	coina ("k") adj. "alive" (LT1:257; Tolkien's later Quenya also has cuina, though coina may still be a valid word: properly, the root of words for “life” is coi- rather than cui-, the latter referring to “awakening” instead)
coirë noun "stirring", in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 54 days (Appendix D), but translated "the first day of Spring" in the Silmarillion Appendix (SA:cuivië). Early "Qenya" has coirë ("k") "life" (LT1:257; in Tolkien's later Quenya, the word for "life" is cuilë or coivië; however, cf. the adj. coirëa from a late source).
	coirëa adj. "living" (glossed "alive" in LT1:257); coirëa quenya "living speech" (PM:399, VT49:42)
	coitë ("k") noun "living being" (LT1:257)
	coiva ("k") adj. "awake" (LT1:257 - read *cuiva in LotR-style Quenya? Cf. coivië becoming cuivië. On the other hand, the elements cui- and coi- having to do with life and awakening cannot be wholly separated.
	coivië ("k") noun “life” (coivierya, *“his/her life”, VT49:41, 42). In early material, the word is glossed “awakening" instead (LT1:257; in LotR-style Quenya cuivië, as in Cuiviénen)
	#Coivienéni place-name, "Qenya" form of Cuiviénen, the Waters of Awakening (VT14:5)
	#col- vb. "bear, carry", not attested by itself by suggested by colindo and colla, q.v.; also compare Tancol.
	colca ("k") noun "box" (QL:47)
	#colindo noun "bearer", pl. #colindor in cormacolindor “ring-bearers” (q.v.)
	colla passive participle "borne, worn" (compare #col- "bear"); also used as a noun = "vestment, cloak" (MR:385). Variant form collo "cloak" (SA:thin(d) ) in the name Sindicollo (q.v.), sc. colla with a masculine ending.
	[colma ("k") noun "ring (on finger)" (VT45:23). See corma.]
cólo ("k") noun "burden" (VT39:10)
combë (“k”) noun “gathering, assembly, assemblage, collection”. Also ocombë (PE17:158)
comya- (“k”) vb. “gather, assemble” (transitive) (PE17:158)
	condo (“k”) noun “prince, leader; lord” (PE17:113,117); possibly replaces cundu, q.v.
	[cópa] ("k") noun "harbour, bay" (KOP; changed to hópa, KHOP). Early "Qenya" likewise has cópa (also cópas) ("k") "harbour" (LT1:257).

	corco ("k") noun "crow" (KORKA, see KARKA)
	corda ("k") noun "temple" (LT1:257)

	corima ("k") adj. "round" (LT1:257; rather corna in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	corin ("k") noun "circular enclosure" (KOR). In the early "Qenya Lexicon", this word was defined as "a circular enclosure, especially on a hill-top" (LT1:257). (Con-)alcorin ("k") *"blessed garth (in the centre)" (VT27:20, 23, 24)
	Corlairë ("k"), place-name, apparently shortened from Corollairë, Coron Oiolairë (MR:107)
	#corma noun "ring", isolated from #cormacolindo "Ring-bearer", pl. cormacolindor (LotR3:VI ch. 4, translated in Letters:308); Cormarë "Ringday", a festival held on Yavannië 30 in honour of Frodo Baggins (Appendix D)
	cormë ("k") noun *"circular enclosure, garth", or possibly *mound" (VT27:20, 24, 25)

	corna ("k") adj. "round, globed" (KOR)
	cornë ("k") noun "loaf" (LT1:257)
	[Coroloisi] ("k"), noun: possibly an empheral name of the Elves "not of Kor" in the Blessed Realm. Tolkien changed this plural from Coroloiti (VT45:29). It is not quite clear what the intended singular is.
	Corollairë ("Korollairë"), place-name; see Coron Oiolairë.
	[Corolóra] ("k"), possibly a synonym of Ilcorin, q.v. (VT45:29)
	coromindo ("k") noun "cupola, dome" (KOR)
	coron (1) noun "mound" (SA); Coron Oiolairë ("Koron"), place-name: the "Mound of Eversummer" where the Two Trees grew. Also contracted Corollairë (WJ:401) and Corlairë (MR:107); both are spelt with an initial k in the sources.
	coron (2) ("k") (corn-, as in dat. sg. cornen) noun "globe, ball" (KOR)
	Cosmoco ("k") masc. name "Gothmog" (LT2:344)
	cos (cost-) noun “the quarrel, dispute, the matter discussed, legal action” (QL:48). Cf. costa-.
	costa- ("k") vb. "quarrel" (KOT > KOTH)
	#cotto (“k”) noun “enemy”, isolated from Moricotto “Dark Enemy”, a Quenya form of Morgoth (VT49:25). Compare cotumo, *notto.
	cotumo ("k") noun "enemy" (KOT > KOTH)
	cotya ("k") adj. "hostile" (KOT > KOTH)
	cú ("k") noun "arch, crescent" (KU3); "crescent Moon" (LT1:271; the long vowel was denoted by a circumflex rather than an accent in the early "Qenya" lexicon). In Sindarin, the same word can be used for a “bow” as used to shoot arrows (but possibly this is only quinga in Quenya).
	cua, see cucua
	cucua ("k") noun "dove" (KŪ; in the Etymologies as printed in LR, Tolkien's manuscript was misread as two distinct words **cu and **cua; see VT45:24. According to the same source, an ephemeral word for "dove" was indeed cua, but Tolkien changed it to cucua.)
	cuilë ("k") noun "life, being alive" (KUY)
	culusta (“k”) “a gold-coin” (QL:49)
	cuina ("k") adj. "alive" (KUY). See coina.

	cuivë ("k") noun "awakening" (KUY)
	cuivëa ("k") adj. "wakening" (KUY).
cuivië noun "awakening" (early "Qenya" coivië, q.v., but this word Tolkien later used = *“life”). In Cuiviénen, "Water of Awakening" (SA:cuivië, SA:nen, KUY; spelt with a k in the Etymologies). Somewhat surprisingly, cuivië is used to mean "life" in cuivie-lancassë ("k"), literally 'on the brink of life' ("of a perilous situation in which one is likely to fall into death") (VT42:8) The form coivië is used for “life” elsewhere.
	culda ("k") adj. "flame-coloured, golden-red" (KUL); maybe it can also be translated “scarlet”, since this gloss was listed for the possible “Noldorin”/Sindarin cognate coll (VT45:24), though it was struck out   
	culina ("k") adj. "flame-coloured, golden-red" (KUL; cullina ("k") in VT45:24 would seem to be a variant)
	†cullo ("k") noun "red gold" (KUL, VT45:24)
	[culo, culu ("k") noun "gold" (substance)] (KUL, VT49:47; the word culu also occurred in early "Qenya" [LT1:258], but in the Etymologies it was struck out; the regular Quenya word for "gold" is apparently malta. In another version, culo meant "flame" [VT45:24], but this is apparently also a word Tolkien abandoned.)
	culucalmalínen ("k") noun in instrumental case: "with golden lights" (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
	culuina ("k") (1) adj. "orange" (colour not fruit) (KUL)
	[culuina ("k") (2) (misread as **culuinn in the Etymologies as printed in LR; see VT45:24)] adj. "of gold" (KUL; this word was struck out, and culuina became the adjective "orange" instead.)
	culuma ("k") noun "orange" (fruit not colour) (KUL)
	culumalda noun: a kind of tree (evidently orange-tree, culuma + alda) (SA:mal-)
	Culúrien another name of Laurelin; apparently derived from the stem KUL- "golden-red" (Silm; LR:365)
	culuvai ("k") ??? (Narqelion)
	cúma ("k") noun "the Void" (KUM, (GAS) )
	cumbë ("k") noun "mound, heap" (KUB)
	cumna ("k") adj. "empty" (KUM)
	cúna ("k") 1) adj. "bent, curved", from which is derived 2) cúna- vb. "bend", occurring with a- prefix (changed by Tolkien from a na-prefix) in Markirya. Here cúna- is intransitive; we do not know whether it can also be transitive "bend".
	cundo noun "guardian" (PM:260), “lord” (PE17:117)
	†cundu ("k") noun "prince" (KUNDŪ; the "†" indicating that this word is poetic or archaic was omitted in the Etymologies as printed in LR; see VT45:24). Cf. condo.
	cúnë ("k") noun "crescent, bow" (LT1:271). Cf. cú.
	cunta, also cunya, vb. (or less likely noun) “rule” (PE17:117)
	curo (curu-) noun "a skillful [?device ­- Tolkien's handwriting was illegible]". (VT41:10)
	curu noun "skill" in names like Curufinwë (q.v.) and Sindarin Curufin, Curunir. (SA; possibly the same as curo, curu- above – but there was a word curu ["k"] in Tolkien's early "Qenya", glossed "magic, wizardry" [LT1:269]).
	Curufinwë (so spelt in Silm; "Kurufinwë" in PM), masc. name *"Skillful Finwë", a name of Fëanor (PM:343); also the origin of the Sindarin name Curufin; Fëanor named his favourite son after himself. Short Quenya name Curvo. (PM:352)
	Curumo masc. name *"Cunning One", "Saruman" (UT:401)
	curuni ("k") noun "witch" (of the good magic) (LT1:269)
	curuvar ("k") noun "wizard" (LT1:269 – but Gandalf, Saruman etc. were istari)
	Curvo, see Curufinwë
	curwë ("k") noun "craft" (KUR), "skill of the hand" (VT41:10), Curwë ("K") "technical skill and invention" (PM:360 cf. 344)


<D>
	-da suffix used to derive nouns denoting the result of an action, like yulda “draught, the amount drunk” (the stem YUL is here given the meaning “drink”). (PE17:68) Cf. also carda “deed” (q.v.) vs. the verb car- “do”.
	-dil, -ndil, ending that Tolkien likened to Old English "-wine", sc. "-friend" as part of names, e.g. Elendil, Eärendil (NIL/NDIL); see the entry -ndil. Also long -dildo (VT46:4), and possibly -(n)dilmë as the corresponding feminine form (see Vardilmë).
	-duinë, see nuinë, Nunduinë
	-dur see -ndur 

<E>
é adverbial particle "indeed" that may be prefixed to a sentence (VT45:11). Short e in the sentence e man antaváro? "what will he give indeed?" (LR:63).
	ëa (1) (sometimes "eä") vb. "is" (CO), in a more absolute sense ("exists", VT39:7/VT49:28-29) than the copula ná. Eä "it is" (VT39:6) or "let it be". The verb is also used in connection with prepositional phrases denoting a position, as in the relative sentences i or ilyë mahalmar ëa “who is above all thrones” (CO) and i ëa han ëa *“who is beyond [the universe of] Eä” (VT43:14). Eä is said to the be “pres[ent] & aorist” tense (VT49:29). The past tense of ëa is engë (VT43:38, VT49:29; Tolkien struck out the form ëanë, VT49:30), the historically correct perfect should be éyë, but the analogical form engië was more common; the future tense is euva (VT49:29). See also ëala. – Eä is also used as a noun denoting "All Creation", the universe (WJ:402; Letters:284, footnote), but this term for the universe "was not held to include [souls?] and spirits" (VT39:20); contrast ilu. One version of Tolkien's Quenya Lord's Prayer includes the words i ëa han ëa, taken to mean "who is beyond Eä" (VT43:14). Tolkien noted that ëa “properly cannot be used of God since ëa refers only to all things created by Eru directly or mediately”, hence he deleted the example Eru ëa *”God exists” (VT49:28, 36). However, ëa is indeed used of Eru in CO (i Eru i or ilyë mahalmar ëa “the One who is above all thrones”) as well as in various Átaremma versions (see VT49:36), so such a distinction may belong to the refined language of the “loremasters” rather than to everyday useage. 
	Eä (2) noun “the universe”, so called because Ilúvatar used the command “Eä! Let these things be!” when he gave independent being to the Music of the Ainur (Ainulindalë). See ëa #1 for references. 
 ëa (3) "eagle" (LT1:251, LT2:338), a “Qenya” word apparently superseded by soron, sornë in Tolkien's later forms of Quenya.
	ëala noun "being, spirit" (pl. ëalar is attested), spirits whose natural state it is to exist without a physical body, like Balrogs (MR:165). The word apparently originates from the participle of ëa, q.v.
	Eämbar noun ”dispositions and will of Eru, with regard to Creation as a whole” (PE17:105)
	ëar noun "sea" (AYAR/AIR [gives also dat. sg. ëaren], WJ:413; see Letters:386 for etymology). Not to be confused with the pl. form of the verb ëa “be, exist”. Pl. ëari "seas" (FS, LR:47); Eär "the Great Sea" (cf. ëaron “ocean”), ablative Eärello "from the Great Sea", et Eärello "out of the Great Sea" (EO). Eärë noun "the open sea" (SD:305). Compound ëaruilë noun "seaweed" (UY). Found in proper names like Eärendil "Sea-friend", Eärendur masc. name, *"Sea-servant"; in effect a variant of Eärendil (Appendix A). Eärendur was also used ="(professional) mariner" (Letters:386). Fem. name Eärwen "Sea-maiden" (Silm); Eärrámë "Sea-wing", "Wings of the Sea", name of Tuor's ship (RAM, AYAR/AIR, SA)
	ëaren noun "eagle" or "eyrie" (LT1:251; this early "Qenya" word is evidently no more valid than ëa "eagle" in LotR-style Quenya.)
	Eärendil, masc. name; see ëar. Eärendilyon noun "son of Eärendel" ("used of any mariner") (LT1:251)
	Eärnil masc. name, contraction of Eärendil (Appendix A)
	Eärnur masc.name, contraction of Eärendur (Appendix A)
	ëaron noun “ocean” (PE17:27), also airon. Cf. ëar. 
	ec- (“k”) verb denoting an opportunity, with the one having the opportunity in dative: ecë nin carë sa “I can do it” (it-is-open for-me to-do it), ecë nin? “please, may I?”, ecuva nin care sa noa “I may do [have a chance of doing] do that tomorrow”. This construction is said to denote “have chance, opportunity or permission” (VT49:20, 34) 
	ecca (“k”) noun “hole”, apparently associated with Sindarin torech “secret hole, lair” (PE17:188)
	eccaira ("k") adj. "remote, far" (KHAYA)
ecces- (“k”) (þ) vb. “to find out, bring out by examining, or eyeing[?]” (PE17:156). Pa.t. probably *eccensë; compare ces-.
	eces, see exa
	ecco ("k") noun "spine". (In the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry EK/EKTE, the gloss is given as "spear", but according to VT45:12 this is a misreading of Tolkien's manuscript.)
	#eccoita- vb. "awake" (VT27:10)
	ecet ("k") noun "short broad-bladed sword" (UT:284)
	ectelë ("k") noun "fountain", also cectelë ("k") (LT1:257, LT2:338; in LotR-style Quenya ehtelë)
	#ecya adj. "sharp" in Ecyanáro ("k") "Sharp Flame", masc. name, Sindarin Aegnor (VT41:14, 19). The Quenya form of Aegnor is elsewhere given as Aicanáro instead.
	#effírië noun "death" (isolated from effíriemmo "of our death"). A verbal stem *effir- "expire, die" seems to be implied. (VT43:34)
	[ehtar] noun "spearman" (EK/EKTE, VT45:12)]
	ehtë (stem *ehti-, given the primitive form ekti) noun "spear" (EK/EKTE). Another word for “spear” is hatal.
	ehtelë noun "issue of water, spring" (SA:kel-, KEL, ET). Compare “Qenya” ectelë ("k") "fountain" (LT1:257, LT2:338; in LotR-style Quenya ehtelë).
	ehtyar noun "spearman" (EK/EKTE). According to VT45:12, Tolkien at one point also meant ehtyar to be the name of Tengwa #15 with overposed dots to indicate a palatal sound; the letter would thus have the value hty. However, according to the classical Tengwar spelling of Quenya as outlined in LotR Appendix E, such a letter would rather have the value **ncy (since #15 is there assigned the value nc in Quenya), but since **ncy is not a possible Quenya combination, a palatal variant of #15 would not occur in the classical Quenya mode.
	Ekkaia place-name, denoting the outer ocean: for *et-gaya "out-sea"? (Silm)
	†él noun "star", pl. éli given (WJ:362, EL)
	ela! interjection "behold!" (directing sight to an actually visible object) (WJ:362)
	Elatan, masc. name *"Star-man", cf. atan (UT:210)
	elda 1. originally adj. "of the stars", but wholly replaced (WJ:362) by: 2. noun (Elda) = one of the people of the Stars, (high-)elf, an Elf (SA:êl, elen, Letters:281, ELED, ÉLED; notice that Tolkien abandoned a former etymology with "depart"), chiefly in the pl. Eldar (WJ:362, cf. GAT(H), TELES). The primitive form Tolkien variously cited as ¤eledā / elenā (Letters:281, PE17:152) and ¤eldā (WJ:360). Partitive pl. Eldali (VT49:8), gen. pl. Eldaron (WJ:368, PM:395, 402); dative pl. eldain "for elves", for Eldar (FS); possessive sg. Eldava "Elf's" (WJ:407); possessive pl. Eldaiva (WJ:368), Eldaivë governing a plural word (WJ:369). The word Eldar properly refers to the non-Avari Elves only, but since Eldar rarely had any contact with the Avari, it could be used for "elves" in general (in LT1:251, Elda is simply glossed "Elf"). See also Eldo. – The plural form Eldar should not require any article when the reference is to the entire people; i Eldar refers to a limited group, “(all) the Elves previously named”; nevertheless, Tolkien in some sources does use the article even where the reference seems to be generic (i Eldar or i-Eldar, VT49:8).
	Eldacan ("k") masc. name "Ælfnoth", Elf-bold (KAN)
	Eldacar masc. name, *"Elfhelm". Compare carma "helmet". (Appendix A)
	Elda-lambë noun "the language of the Eldar" (WJ:368)
Eldalië noun "the Elven-folk" (often used vaguely to mean all the race of Elves, though it properly did not include the Avari) (WJ:374, ÉLED; possessive Eldaliéva in the name Mindon Eldaliéva, q.v.) “Qenya” genitive in -n in Eldalien as part of the title Quenta Eldalien “History of the Elves” (SD:303).
Eldamar place-name "Elvenhome" (ÉLED; found already in Narqelion), according to MR:176 another name of Tirion (see tir-).
Eldameldor noun "Elf-lovers" (WJ:412), sg. #Eldameldo
Eldandil (pl. Eldandili in WJ:412) noun "Elf-friend" (by the Edain confused with Elendil, properly "Star-friend") (WJ:410)
Eldanor place-name "Elvenland", regions of Valinor where the Elves dwelt and the stars could be seen (MR:176)
Eldanyárë noun "History of the Elves" (LR:199, there with the definite article: I·Eldanyárë). See nyárë.
	Eldarin adj. derived from Elda: "Eldarin, Elvish" (Silm, ÉLED). Also in the longer form Eldarinwa (pl. Eldarinwë in VT47:14, in the title Eldarinwë leperi ar notessi, "The Eldarin fingers and numerals")
	Eldarissa, Eldaquet ("q") noun, apparently other names of Qenya (LT2:348)
	Eldavehtë noun *”Elf-haunt”, description of Beleriand as “a habitation, haunt or place occupied by Eldar. See vehtë. (PE17:189)
	Eldo noun, archaic variant of Elda, properly one of the "Marchers" from Cuiviénen, but the word went out of use (WJ:363, 374)
	élë noun "flashing of [?starry] light" (VT45:12; Tolkien's gloss was not certainly legible)
	Elemmírë noun *"Star-jewel" (elen + míre, notice assimilation nm > mm), name of a star/planet (possibly Mercury, MR:435, where the spelling used is Elemmirë); also name of an Elf. (SA:mîr)
	elen noun "star" (SA:êl, elen, EL, VT49:39); pl. eleni (occasionally in verse: eldi) (WJ:362, PE17:127); partitive pl. elelli for *elenli (PE17:127), gen. pl. elenion in the phrase Elenion Ancalima "brightest of stars" (LotR2:IV ch. 9; see Letters:385 for translation); elen atta “two stars” (VT49:44), genitive elen atto “of two stars” (VT49:45), eleni neldë “three stars”, archaic elenion neldë = *“of stars three”. Genitive “of 3 stars” = elenion neldë (for archaic elenion neldëo) (VT49:45). Allative elenna "starwards" used as name of Númenor (Silm; see Elenna); ablative pl. elenillor "from stars" in Markirya. Nai elen siluva *”may a star shine”, VT49:38.
elena adj. "of the stars" (SA:êl, elen); also elenya
	Elenarda place-name "Star-kingdom", upper sky (3AR). Deleted material in the Etymologies defined elenarda as "star-realm", "upper air or sky" (VT45:16). Compare elen, (h)arda.
	Elendë (1) place-name "Elvenhome", regions of Valinor where the Elves dwelt and the stars could be seen (MR:176, ÉLED). Plural ablative elendellor in the phrase et elendellor, evidently *"out of the elf-lands" (VT45:13).
	elendë (2), pa.t. of lelya- #1
	Elendil masc. name "Star-friend", "Lover or student of stars", applied to those devoted to astronomical lore. However, when the Edain used this name they intended it to mean "Elf-friend", confusing elen "star" and elda "elf" (WJ:410). (This idea that the name was misapplied seems to be late; Tolken earlier interpreted the name as an ancient compound Eled + ndil so that the meaning really was "Elf-friend"; see Letters:386. See also NIL/NDIL in the Etymologies, where Elendil is equated with "Ælfwine", Elf-friend.) Allative Elendilenna "to Elendil" (PM:401); Elendil Vorondo genitive of Elendil Voronda "Elendil the Steadfast" (CO) Pl. Elendili the Númenórean Elf-friends (Silm); the variant Elendilli in SD:403 would seem to presuppose a stem-form Elendill- not attested elsewhere. Tar-Elendil a Númenorean king, UT:210.
	Elendur masc. name, *"Star-servant", probably intended to mean *"Elf-servant"; in effect a variant of Elendil (Appendix A). The name was also used in Númenor (UT:210).
	Elenna place-name "Starwards", a name of Númenor: Elenna-nórë *"Starwards-land", "the land named Starwards", genitive Elenna-nórëo in CO.
	Elentári noun "Star-queen", title of Varda (EL, SA:tar)
	Elenwë fem. name *"Star-person" (Silm)
	elenya adj. *"stellar" (only defined as an adjective referring to stars by Tolkien) (WJ:362). Cf. Elenya, name of the first day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the stars (Appendix D).
	Elerína adj. used as noun:"star-crowned", a name of Taniquetil (EL, RIG), spelt Elerrína in Silm
	*Elerondo masc. name “Star-vault”, Sindarin Elrond. Extrapolated from Elerondiel "daughter of Elrond“, patronym of Arwen (PE17:56); cf. Elerossë, rondo. 
	Elerossë masc. name, "star foam", starlit foam, Sindarin Elros (PM:348)
	Elerrína adj. used as noun: "Crowned with Stars" (elen + rína), a name of Taniquetil (Silm); spelt Elerína in the Etymologies (EL, RIG).
	Elessar masc. name "Elf-stone" (Elen + sar, actually *"Star-stone", cf. Elendil concerning elen "star" being used to mean "Elf") (LotR3:V ch. 8). Genitive Elesarno (VT49:28, read *Elessarno?) indicates that the stem is -sarn-. As a common noun, elessar or “elf-stone” may signify “beryl” (in the chapter Flight to the Ford in the LotR, Aragorn finds “a single pale-green jewel” and declares: “It is a beryl, an elf-stone”). Elessar as a name may also be seen as a pun or variant of Elesser "Elf-friend".
	Elesser masc. name, = Old English Ælfwine, Elf-friend. (SER)
	Ellairë alternative name of June (PM:135); evidently incorporating lairë "summer"; the el- part is probably an assimilated form of er-, an element meaning one or first, June being the first summer month.
	ellë vb. "came", pl. eller with a plural subject (MC:215; this is "Qenya"; in later Quenya, ellë could be the emphatic pronoun "you", pl., corresponding to singular elyë "thou" – at least in the conceptual phase where -llë was the ending for plural "you".)
	-ello ablative ending (VT45:28); see -llo
	[ello] noun "call, shout of triumph" (GYEL (< GEL) )
	*elmë, see emmë #2
	elmenda noun "wonder" (PE13:143)
	Elpino noun "Christ", Tolkien's attempt to render this title into Quenya; the intended etymology of the Quenya word is uncertain (VT44:15-16; Tolkien apparently dropped this form and replaced it with a phonological adaptation of "Christ": Hristo or Hrísto.)
	elvëa adj. "starlike, like stars", pl. elvië in Markirya
	Elwë masc. name, *"Star-person" (PM:340, WJ:369, WEG, VT45:12). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, Elwë was also the name of a Tengwa similar in form to Roman c, which in a full-vowel mode denoted a (short) e. (VT45:17; in the Sindarin "Mode of Beleriand", exemplified in the LotR itself, this letter has the value a instead. Elsewhere in the Etymologies itself, this symbol is called Ossë [q.v.] and is assigned the value o.)
	elwen noun "heart" (LT1:255; rather hón or enda in LotR-style Quenya)
	elyë pron. "even thou", emphatic 2. person sg. pronoun (Nam, RGEO:67, VT43:26, 27, 28, 30)
	emel noun “mother”; also amal (VT48:22, 49:22); the form amil (emil) seems more usual.
	emenya, see emya
	emerwen noun "shepherdess" (UT:209, 434)
	emil noun "mother", emilinya "my mother" (also reduced to emya) the terms a child would use in addressing his or her mother (VT47:26). Emil would seem to be a variant of amil. Also compare emel.
	emma noun *“picture” (compounded in indemmar “mind-pictures”) (PE17:179)
	emmë (1) noun "mummy", hypocoristic form of "mother", also used in children's play for "index finger" and "index toe" (VT47:10, 26, VT48:4, 6, 17, 19). Also emya.
	emmë (2) pron. "we", emphatic pronoun; dative emmen (VT43:12, 20). In the source this pronoun is intended as the 1st person plural exclusive; later Tolkien changed the corresponding pronominal ending from -mmë to -lmë, and the plural emphatic pronoun would likewise change from emmë to *elmë. Since the ending -mmë was redefined as a dual exclusive pronoun, the form emmë may still be valid as such, as a dual emphatic pronoun "we" = "(s)he and I".
	*empanya- vb. "plant" (deduced from the "Qenya" pl. past tense empannen, VT27:20-22)
	emya noun "mummy", also used in children's play for "index finger" and "index toe" (VT47:10, 26, VT48:4, 6). Said to be a reduction of emenya *"my mother", seemingly presupposing #emë as a word for "mother" (but this word normally appears as emil or amil, incorporating a feminine ending). In VT48:19, emya is explained as deriving from em-nya "my mother". Compare emmë # 2.
	en (1) interjection "there, look! yon (yonder)" (EN, VT45:12)
	en (2), also ena, adv. “still”; quetir en “they still say” (PE17:167)
	en (3) particle that may be inserted before a past tense form to indicate that it refers to a remote past (VT45:12), apparently twice attested in Fíriel's Song (LR:72), e.g. en cárë ("k") "made" (long ago). This particle may have been obsoleted by en “still” from a later source.
	en- (4) prefix "again-", “re-“ (PE17:68), in enquantuva "shall refill", entuluva, "shall come again", Envinyatar "Renewer", envinyanta "healed, *renewed", enyalië "to recall" (Nam, RGEO:67, LotR3:V ch. 8, VT41:16, MR:405, UT:317; as for the etymology of en-, see comments on Common Eldarin base EN "again, once more" in VT48:25)
	-enca suffix “without, -less” (PE17:167), cf. nec-, q.v.
	encë, see enquë
	enda noun "heart", but not referring to the physical organ; it literally means "centre" (cf. endë) and refers to the fëa (soul) or sáma (mind) itself. (VT39:32)
	Endamar place-name "Middle-earth" (EN, MBAR, NDOR). However, Middle-earth is normally called Endor, Endórë.
	endaquet- vb. “answer” (gloss uncertain) (PE17:167)
	endë noun "core, centre, middle" (NÉD, EN, VT48:25)
	#endëa adj. "middle" in atendëa, q.v. Compare enya. 
	Ender noun "bridegroom", surname of Tulkas (NDER, TULUK, VT45:11). The form Enderō (VT45:11) is defined as "[?virile] young bridegroom"; Tolkien's gloss was not entirely legible. But this would seem to be an archaic form, because of the long final -ō (later Quenya *Endero). 
	enderi noun "middle-days" (sg. *enderë), in the calendar of Imladris three days inserted between the months (or seasons) yávië and quellë (Appendix D)
	Endien noun, alternative term for "autumn" (PM:135). In the Etymologies, the word Endien was assigned a quite different meaning: "Midyear, Midyear week", in the calendar of Valinor a week outside the months, between the sixth and seventh months, dedicated to the Trees; also called Aldalemnar (YEN, LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK)
	Endor place-name "Middle-earth" (SA:dôr, NDOR), "centre of the world" (EN); also long form Endórë "Middle-earth" (Appendix E); allative Endorenna "to Middle-earth" in EO. The form Endór in MR:121 may be seen as archaic, intermediate between Endórë and Endor (since long vowels in a final syllable are normally shortened: Endór > Endor). Endór functions as an uninflected genitive in the source: Aran Endór, "King of Middle-earth".
	endya > enya adj. "middle" (ÉNED)
	enel prep. "between" = "at the central position in a row, list, series, etc. but also applied to the case of three persons" (VT47:11). This preposition refers to the position of a thing between others of the same kind; compare imbë.
	[eneldë, enellë, enestil noun "middle finger" (VT47:26)]
	enelmo noun "a go-between, intervener, intermediary [as noun], mediator" (VT47:14) 
	enenquë cardinal "sixteen" (VT48:21)
	enetya, see entya
	enga prep. "save" (= except) (FS)
	engë vb. "was", "existed", past tense of ëa, q.v. (VT43:38, VT49:29)
	engië vb. “has been”, “has existed”, perfect tense of ëa, q.v. (VT49:29)
engwa adj. "sickly"; nominal pl. Engwar "the Sickly", Elvish name of Mortal Men (Silm, GENG-WĀ)
engwë noun "thing" (VT39:7, VT49:28). – Extrapolation may also point to *engwë as an emphatic dual inclusive pronoun “we” (thou and I), corresponding to the ending -ngwë.
[enna adj. "first" (VT45:12)]
	enquanta- vb. “refill” (PE17:167), enquantuva vb. "shall refill" (Nam); cf. see en-, quat-, quanta-
enquë ("q") cardinal "six" (ÉNEK, VT48:4, 6, 9, VT49:57); enquëa ordinal "sixth" (VT42:25); see also enquië. According to VT48:8, the word for "six" may have been encë ("k") in very early Quenya (the form is asterisked by Tolkien), but this was altered to enquë under the influence of yunquë "twelve" (perceived as meaning "2 times 6", *yú-enquë, with the prefix yú- "twi-").
enquesta fraction "one sixth" (1/6) (VT48:11)
enquete- vb. “repeat, say again” (PE17:167)
	enquië noun, Eldarin six-day week, pl. enquier (Appendix D). Cf. enquë "6". Compare lemnar, otsola.
	enta demonstrative "that yonder" (EN). In VT47:15, enta is defined as "another, one more" (but it may seem that Tolkien also considered the word exë for this meaning).
	Entar place-name "Thither Lands, Middle-earth, Outer Lands, East" (seen from Aman) (EN)
	Entarda place-name "Thither Lands, Middle-earth, Outer Lands, East" (seen from Aman) (EN, VT45:12)
entë (1) conj. "moreover, further, furthermore, what is more" (VT47:15, VT48:14). Compare yunquentë as a variant of yunquenta, q.v.
	entë (2) noun "center" (VT41:16; endë is perhaps to be preferred, see entya)
	ento adv. "next" (Arct)
	entulessë noun "return" (UT:171)
	entya, enetya adj. "central, middle" (VT41:16; these forms, as well as the noun entë "centre", come from a late, somewhat confused source; the adjective #endëa and the noun endë from earlier material may fit the general system better, and #endëa is even found in the LotR itself as part of the word atendëa, q.v.)
	Enu masc. name, "the Almighty Creator who dwells without the world" (LT2:343 - in Tolkien's later Quenya, the divine name appears as Eru instead)
	Envinyatar noun "the Renewer" (LotR3:V ch. 8)
	envinyanta passive participle "healed" (MR:405), pointing to a verbal stem #envinyata- "heal", literally "renew"; cf. Aragorn's title Envinyatar "the Renewer" (LotR3:V ch. 8).
	enwa adv. "tomorrow" (QL:34)
	enwina adj. "old" (Markirya)  
	enya < endya adj. "middle" (EN). Compare #endëa.
	#enyal- vb. "to recall", "to commemorate", gerund/infinitive enyalië with infinitival ending -ië; dative enyalien "for the re-calling", "[in order] to recall" in CO.
	enyárë adv. "in that day" (pointing to the future) (FS)
	Eönwë masc. name, a Maia, herald of Manwë; a name evidently adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:417). In some sources the same character is called Fionwë, which would seem to be an Elvish form.
epë prep. "before" (“in all relations but time”, VT49:32), though the word was glossed "after" when first published (VT42:32; Bill Welden, the writer of the article in question, later presented this correction in VT44:38). The preposition can indeed express “after” when used of time, since the Eldar imagined future time (time that comes after the present) as being “before” them (VT49:12, 32); epë is in this respect a variant of apa, q.v. (Cf. VT49:22.) Compare epessë, q.v. Epë "before" may also be used in comparison (PE17:56, 57), apparently in much the same way as lá #2 (q.v.) (VT42:32)
	epessë noun "after-name", nickname, mostly given as a title of admiration or honour (PM:339, UT:266, VT49:12). Cf. essë "name" and epë above.
	epeta adv. “following that, thereupon, thence, whereupon” (epë + ta #1). Also epta. (VT49:12)
	epetai adv. “consequently” (VT49:11). Since this is to contain tai “that which” (epe-ta-i “before that which”), a form Tolkien may later have abandoned, the less problematic synonym etta should perhaps be preferred. Compare potai.
	epta = epeta, q.v.
	equë vb. "say/says" or "said" (a tenseless pseudo-verb used to introduce quotations or a "that"-construction); with affixes equen "said I", eques "said he/she" (WJ:392, 415)
	eques (equess-, as in pl. equessi) noun "a saying, dictum, a quotation from someone's uttered words, a current or proverbial dictum" (WJ:392); I Equessi Rúmilo "the Sayings of Rúmil" (WJ:398)
	er cardinal "one, alone" (ERE, VT48:6, VT49:54), in an early source also adv. "only, but, still" (LT1:269); Eru er "one God" (VT44:17; er was here emended by Tolkien from erëa, which seems to be an adjectival form *"one, single".)
	#er- "remain", verb (LT1:269; given in the form erin and glossed "remains"; erin would have to mean "I remain" in Tolkien's later Quenya, if this word is to be adapted. However, the later synonym lemya- may be preferred.)
	erca ("k") (1) noun "prickle, spine"
erca- ("k") (2) vb. "to prick" (ERÉK)
	Ercambo ("k") masc. name "one-hand Man" (VT47:7), the equivalent of Sindarin Erchamon, Erchamion as a title of Beren
	ercassë ("k") noun "holly" (ERÉK)
	Ercoirë noun, alternative name of February (PM:135)
	erda adj. "solitary, deserted" (LT1:269)
	erdë (1) noun "seed, germ" (ERÉD, VT45:12)
erdë (2) noun "singularity", the person as a whole (MR:216)
erdë (3) noun "repose" (marked by Tolkien with an "X", perhaps indicating that he considered dropping this form to eliminate homophones) (VT46:12). Compare sérë.
	erë, eren noun "iron" or "steel"; Eremandu variant of Angamandu (Angband) (LT1:252; "iron" should be anga in LotR-style Quenya, but erë, eren may still be used for "steel". See also yaisa.)
	erëa adj.? "one" or *"single", apparently an adjectival form (see er) (VT44:17)
	Eremandu place-name "Hells of Iron", a name of Angband (LT1:249)
	eressë noun "solitude" (ERE). In early "Qenya", eressë was an adjective or adverb: "singly, only, alone" (LT1:269).
eressëa adj. "lonely" (ERE, LT1:269), “solitary” (cf. Letters:386). Eressëa place-name "Lonely (One)", often used by itself for Tol Eressëa, the Lonely Isle (Silm) or Solitary Isle (Letters:386, footnote)
erinqua adj. "single, alone" (VT42:10)
	Erintion noun, second half of the month of avestalis (January) (LT1:252)
	erma noun "physical matter" (MR:338, 470)
	Erquellë noun, alternative name of September (PM:135)
	Errívë noun, alternative name of November (PM:135)
	Ertuilë noun, alternative name of April (PM:135)
	Eru divine name "the One" = God (VT43:32, VT44:16-17), "the One God" (Letters:387), a name reserved for the most solemn occasions (WJ:402). Often in the combination Eru Ilúvatar, "Eru Allfather" (cf. MR:112). Genitive Eruo (MR:329, VT43:28/32), dative Erun (VT44:32, 34). The adjectival form Eruva "divine" (Eruva lissëo "of divine grace", VT44:18) would be identical to the form appearing in the possessive case. Compound nouns: Eruhantalë "Thanksgiving to Eru", a Númenórean festival (UT:166, 436), Eruhin pl. Eruhíni "Children of Eru", Elves and Men (WJ:403; SA:híni, cf. Eruhîn in Letters:345), Eruion *"son of God" (or "God the Son"?) (VT44:16), Erukyermë "Prayer to Eru", a Númenórean festival (UT:166, 436), Erulaitalë "Praise of Eru", a Númenórean festival (UT:166, 436), Eruamillë "Mother of God" (in Tolkien's translation of the Hail Mary, VT43:32, see also VT44:7), Eruontari, Eruontarië other translations of "Mother (Begetter) of God" (VT44:7, 18), Erusén "the children of God" (RGEO:74; this is a strange form with no plural ending; contrast the synonym Eruhíni.) #Eruanna and #erulissë, various terms for "grace", literally "God-gift" and "God-sweetness", respectively (VT43:29; these words are attested in the genitive and instrumental case, respectively: Eruanno, erulissenen).
	Eruman place-name; this is a word to which various meanings are ascribed, but it always denotes some region. In the earliest phases of Tolkien's mythology, it was a region south of Taniquetil (LT1:91, 252-253). In the Etymologies, entry ERE, Eruman is a "desert north-east of Valinor". In the final version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer, where the locative form Erumandë appears, Tolkien appears to have moved Eruman out of this world entirely, making it the abode of God (Eru); Erumandë translates "in heaven".
	erumë noun "desert" (ERE)
	erúmëa adj. "outer, outermost" (LT1:262)
	Eruva, see Eru
	erya adj. "single, sole" (ERE)
	es unidentified word in the phrase es sorni heruion an! "the Eagles of the Lords are at hand" (SD:290); possibly an assimilated form of en, that may function as a kind of deitic particle here: *"Behold the Eagles..."
	[escë] ("k") noun "rustle, noise of leaves" (EZGE)
	essë (1) noun "name", also later name of Tengwa #31, originally (MET) called árë (ázë). (Appendix E). With a pronominal ending esselya "thy name" (VT43:14). Pl. #essi in PM:339 and MR:470, gen.pl. #esseron "of names" in the compound Nómesseron (q.v.); we would rather have expected *ession, given the nom.pl. essi; perhaps #esser is a valid alternative plural form. Essecarmë noun "name-making" (MR:214, 470), Eldarin ceremony where the father announces the name of his child. Essecenta ("k") noun *"Name-essay" (see centa) (MR:415); Essecilmë noun "name-choosing", an Eldarin ceremony where a child named him- or herself according to personal lámatyávë (q.v.) (MR:214, 471). – The meaning Tolkien originally assigned to the word essë in the Etymologies was "place" rather than "name" (VT45:12).
	essë (2) pron? “he” (and also “she, it”?), possible emphatic 3rd sg. emphatic pronoun, attested in the sentence essë úpa nas “he is dumb” (PE17:126)
essë (3) noun "beginning" (ESE/ESET). This entry was marked by a query in Etym, and a word in the appendices to LotR suggests that it was emended to *YESE/YESET; we may therefore read *yessë for essë. (See esta #2.) However, for the purposes of writing the form yesta  “beginning” from PE17:120 may be preferred.
	essëa adj. ?"primary" (gloss not certainly legible); read probably *yessëa in LotR-style Quenya; see esta #2 below (ESE/ESET). The meaning Tolkien originally assigned to the word essëa in the Etymologies was "in place, local" (VT45:12).
	[Esselda], noun? adj.?, deleted form which Tolkien never clearly glossed: *"first-elf"? Or an old comparative (in -lda) denoting something like "elder"? The word occurs in a context where Tolkien is considering terms for the Elves as the "Firstborn", aka "Elder Kindred" (VT45:12, cf. ESE-, ESET-)
	esta- (1) vb. "to name" (ES, VT45:12). In an earlier form of the relevant entry in the Etymologies, Tolkien let esta- mean "to place, set, plant" (VT45:12); a deleted entry SET also had esta- "precede" (VT46:13)
	esta (2) adj. "first" (ESE/ESET); this entry was marked with a query. The word Yestarë (q.v.) *"Beginning-day" in LotR suggests that Tolkien decided to change the stem in question to *YESE/YESET. We could then read *yesta for esta (but later this became a noun “beginning” rather than an adj. “first”, PE17:120) and also prefix a y to the other words derived from ESE/ESET (essë > *yessë, essëa > *yessëa). Estanossë noun "the firstborn", read likewise *Yestanossë (*Yestanessi?) – but in a later text, Tolkien used Minnónar (q.v.) for "the Firstborn" as a name of the Elves, and this form may be preferred. (In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the word Estanossë is cited as "Estanesse", but according to VT45:12, the second-to-last vowel is actually o in Tolkien's manuscript.)
	estat-, see etsat-
	Estë fem. name "Repose, Rest" (WJ:403, EZDĒ, SED), only used as name of a Valië (WJ:404)
	estel noun "trust, hope" (WJ:318-319, MR:320)
	esto emphatic pronoun (?), apparently 3rd person dual, *“even the two of them” (VT49:48). The word comes from a conceptual phase where Tolkien let dual pronouns end in the vowel -o, an idea that was apparently abandoned; also, -st- is associated with the second rather than the third person dual in later sources (see -stë). The ending may have been conceived as *-sto at an earlier stage (VT49:49).
	et prep. (and adv.?) "out", when followed by ablative "out of" (VT45:13) or literally "out from", as in EO: et Eärello "out of the Great Sea"; cf. also et sillumello "from this hour" in VT44:35. Et i pe/péti, untranslated phrase, perhaps *"out of the mouth" (VT47:35). Prefix et- "forth, out" (ET), also in longer form ete- (as in etelehta, eteminya); verb ettuler *"are coming forth" (ettul- = et + tul-). (SD:290; read probably *ettulir or continuative *ettúlar in Tolkien's later Quenya). The forms etemmë and etengwë (VT43:36) seem to incorporate pronominal suffixes for "us", hence ?"out of us", inclusive and exclusive respectively. The pronoun -mmë denoted plural inclusive "we" when this was written, though Tolkien would later make it dual exclusive instead (see -mmë). Second person forms are also given: etelyë, etellë ?"out of you", sg. and pl. respectively (Tolkien would later change the ending for pl. “you” from -llë to -ldë).
	et-henta vb. “read aloud” (PE17:77). Compare henta-.
	etelehta- vb. "deliver" (= "save") (VT43:23)
	etelyë, see et
	etellë, see et
eteminya adj. "prominent" (VT42:24)
etemmë, see et 
etengwë, see et  
eterúna- vb. (also etrúna-, though the cluster tr seems unusual for Quenya) "deliver" (= "save"). Tolkien may have abandoned this verb in favour of etelehta-, q.v. (VT43:23; VT44:9), but the root also appears in #runando "redeemer", so maybe eterúna- can stay with the meaning "redeem".
etsat- vb. "distribute in even portions" (apparently et- "out" + the base sat "divide, apportion"). Not cited with a final hyphen in the source (VT48:11), but some ending would obviously be required in Quenya; the verb should probably be treated as a consonant stem (primary verb). Alternative form estat-, but as pointed out in VT48:12, the transposition ts > st is not regular in Quenya.
etsë noun "outside, exterior", glosses changed from ?"issuing" and ?"spring" (VT45:13)
	etsir noun "mouth of a river" (ET)
	etta adv. “therefore” (VT49:12)
	ettë noun (and/or adv.?) "outside" (ET)
	ettelë noun "outer lands, foreign parts" (ET, VT45:13)
	ettelëa adj. "foreign", perhaps also noun ?"stranger"; the reading of the second gloss is uncertain. In the Etymologies as printed in LR, even the former gloss is presented as an uncertain reading and the Quenya word is given as ettelen. According to VT45:13, the gloss "foreign" is certain and the Quenya word may also be read as ettelëa, which normal Quenya morphology would also suggest to be the correct reading of Tolkien's manuscript.
	#ettul- vb. "come forth", attested in the form ettuler *"are coming forth" (ettul- = et + tul-). Read probably *ettulir or continuative *ettúlar in Tolkien's later Quenya. (SD:290)
	#etya adj. initial element of Etyangoldor “Exiled Noldor”, literal meaning likely something like “outer” or “outside” as adjective; compare preposition et. 
	Etyangoldi ("ñ") noun "Exiled Noldor" (WJ:374). Sg. probably *Etyangol (with stem *Etyangold-).
	euva vb. “will be, will exist”; see ëa
	evandilyon noun "gospel" (QL:36)
	exa adj.? "other" (apparently as adjective) (VT47:10, VT49:33). Also eces (“k”), unless this is intended as the stem underlying exa (the root KES with prefixed stem-vowel) rather than a Quenya word (VT49:33).
	exë noun "the other, *another" (VT47:40, VT49:33). Though Tolkien included the article "the" in his gloss, this may be simply to indicate that exë is a noun, not to suggest that it is inherently definite and does not require the definite article i. Used in an indefinite sense, without i preceding, exë would likely translate as *"another".
	éyë, rare perfect of ëa, q.v.
	ezel, ezella adj. "green" (in Vanyarin Quenya only). Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)
	Ezellohar noun "the Green Mound" where the Two Trees grew; adopted and adapted from Valarin; also translated as Coron Oiolairë, Corollairë (WJ:401). The name must have become *Erellohar in Exilic (Noldorin) Quenya.

<F>
	faica ("k") adj. "contemptible, mean" (SPAY)
	faila adj. "fair-minded, just, generous" (PM:352)
	faina- vb. "emit light" (PHAY)
	fainu- vb. "release" (LT1:250). Rather lerya- or sen- in Tolkien's later Quenya.
fairë (1) noun "phantom, disembodied spirit, when seen as a pale shape" (pl. fairi in Markirya); compare ausa. The noun fairë was also used = "spirit (in general)", as a kind of being (MR:349, PE17:124). In VT43:37 and VT44:17, fairë refers to the Holy Spirit (fairë aista or Aina Fairë)
	fairë (2) noun "natural death" (as act) (PHIR)
fairë (3) noun "radiance" (PHAY)
fairë (4) adj. "free" (LT1:250) (rather léra, lerina or mirima in LotR-style Quenya)
	fairië noun "freedom" (LT1:250; since this is an abstract formation based on fairë "free", a meaning only ascribed to this word in early "Qenya" whereas fairë has a string of other meanings in Tolkien's later Quenya, the conceptual validity of fairië "freedom" may be questioned).
	Falanyel (Falanyeld-, as in pl. Falanyeldi), noun, (in the pl.) a name of the Teleri, apparently *"Shore-singers" (PHAL/PHÁLAS)
	falas (falass-), falassë noun "shore, beach" (LT1:253, LT2:339); falassë "shore, line of surf" (SA:falas), "shore – especially one exposed to great waves and breakers" (VT42:15), "beach" (PHAL/PHÁLAS); Falassë Númëa place-name "Western Surf" (LT1:253), Andafalassë “Langstrand” (PE17:135)
	falasta- vb. "to foam", participle falastala "foaming, surging" in Markirya
	falastanë participle (?) "surging", falastanéro vb. "was loud with surf" (MC:213, 220; this is "Qenya" - the participle "surging" is falastala in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Falastur masc. name, *"Shore-lord" (Appendix A)
	fallë noun "foam" (PHAL/PHÁLAS)
	falma noun "(crested/foaming) wave" (PHAL/PHÁLAS), "a wave-crest, wave" (VT42:15), “foam wave” (PE17:127), “a breaker” (PE17:62), partitive pl. falmali “many waves” (PE17:73), allative falmalinnar "on the foaming waves" in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67); the phrase an i falmalī (PE17:74) seems to be a paraphrase of this with an independent preposition instead of the allative ending -nna (see an #1). Compounded in Falmari, a name of the Teleri, and Mar-nu-Falmar, "Home/Land under Waves", a name of Númenor after the Downfall. (SA:falas) Falmari "wave-folk", a name of the Teleri (PM:386). – In earlier "Qenya", falma was glossed "foam" (LT1:253, cf. MC:213). Compare also the early "Qenya" words falmar "wave as it breaks" (LT1:253), pl. falmari "waves" (MC:216)
	falmar, falmarin (falmarind- or simply falmarin- as in pl. falmarindi [or falmarini]) noun "sea-spirit, nymph" (PHAL/PHÁLAS)
	falqua ("q") noun "cleft, mountain pass, ravine" (LT2:341)
	falquan ("q") noun "large sword" (LT2:341)
	fána, fánë (1) adj. "white" (Markirya - fánë as a sg. form in may be a misreading). Compare fanya.
fána (2) noun "cloud" (SPAN, VT46:15). Cf. fana.
fana noun term denoting the "veils" or "raiment" in which the Valar presented themselves to physical eyes, the bodies in which they were self-incarnated, usually in the shape of the bodies of Elves (and Men) (RGEO:74, PE17:173-180). According to PE17:26, fana may be said to mean “shape” with “added notion” of light and whiteness, “it is thus often used where we might use ‘a vision’ – of something beautiful or sublime”, yet with no connotation of “uncertainty or unreality”.
fánë, strong past tense of fanta, q.v.
	fanga noun "beard" (SPÁNAG)
fangë noun "long beard" (GL:34); this is “Qenya” for later fanga.
fanta- vb. "to veil, cloak, mantle" (VT43:22), mainly used of veils cast over things that shone, or that were brighter and more vivid (PE17:174); according to Tolkien usually the strong past tense fánë and perfect afánië were used, but later also fantanë in the past tense (and then perhaps *afantië in the perfect?) (PE17:179-180) Cf halya- (q.v.), the stem of which Tolkien contrasted with the stem of this verb (PE17:184).
	fantarcenya (“k”) adj. “perspicacious, penetrating of sight or understanding” (PE17:176)
	Fantur masc. name "lord of cloud", surname of Mandos (SPAN, TUR)
	fanwa noun “veil, screen” (PE17:176, 180)
	fanwos noun “mind-picture of apparition in dream”, possibly ephemeral variant of indemma (q.v.) (PE17:174). Normally Quenya phonology seems to prohibit a combination like wo.
	fanya noun "(white) cloud" (translated "sky" in FS); pl. fanyar in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67). ). Used “only of white clouds, sunlit or moonlit, or clouds gilded or silvered at the edges by light behind them”, not “of storm clouds or cloud canopies shutting out the light” (PE17:174). Cf. lumbo, q.v. According to VT46:15, fanya was originally given as an adjective "white" in the Etymologies; the printed version in LR wrongly implies that fanya and fána both mean "cloud", whereas actually the first was at this stage meant to be an adjective "white" whereas fána is both noun "cloud" and adj. "white". However, Namárië and later emendations to the entry SPAN in Etym indicate that Tolkien would later think of fanya as a noun "cloud", perhaps giving it the same double meaning as fána: noun "cloud" as well as adjective "white". According to PE17:26, fanya was originally an adjectival form “white and shining” that was however often used as a noun “applied to various things, notably to white clouds lit by sun or moon”. In Namárië, the word is used poetically with reference to the hands of Varda (she lifted her hands ve fanyar “like clouds”). 
	Fanyamar place-name referring to the "upper air" (SPAN), literally *"Cloudland"
	fanyarë noun "the skies" (not heaven or firmament – the upper airs and clouds). Note that despite its English gloss, fanyarë is a singular word and therefore takes a singular adjective/participle, as in fanyarë rúcina "ruined skies" in Markirya (see MC:220, note 8 for this translation)
	fára noun "beach, shore" (VT46:15)
	fárë noun "sufficiency, plenitude, all that is wanted" (also farmë) (PHAR)
	faren, adv. "enough" (VT46:9)
	fárëa adj.? "enough" (presumably adjective, whereas the adverb is faren); ufárëa "not enough" (FS). Etym has farëa "enough, sufficient" (PHAR)
	farinyë, a pa.t. of farya-, q.v.
	farma noun ?"carpet" (reading of gloss very uncertain; another gloss occurring in the manuscript cannot be certainly interpreted, though the editors suggest "string" or "stray") (VT46:15)
	farmë noun "sufficiency, plenitude, all that is wanted" (also fárë) (VT46:9)
	farnë (1) noun "foliage", archaic faznë (VT46:9). Not to be confused with farnë as the pa.t. of the verb farya-, q.v.
	#farnë (2) noun "dwelling", in orofarnë (as translated in Letters:224, but in other notes of Tolkien’s the word was interpreted “any growing thing or plant”, PE17:83)
	farya- vb. "suffice", pa.t. farnë (PHAR). An additional pa.t. form, farinyë, was published in VT46:9; this is a most unusual formation.
fas (?fats-), fatsë noun "tassel" (GL:34)
fásë noun "gap, gulf" (GL:36)
	fassë noun "tangled hair, shaggy lock" (PHAS)
	fasta- vb. "tangle" (PHAS)
fatanyu noun "hell" (GL:51)
fatsë, fas (with stem *fats-?) noun "tassel" (GL:34)
	fauca ("k") adj. "thirsty" (PHAU; original glosses "thirsty, parched; lit. open-mouthed", VT46:9)
fauta- vb. *"to snow" (actually glossed fauta = "it snows") (GL:35)
fáwë vb. "snow" (GL:35; rather lossë in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Fayanáro archaic form of Fëanáro, q.v. (PM:343)
	faznë, archaic form of farnë, q.v.
	fëa noun "spirit" (pl. fëar attested, MR:363). The Incarnates are said to live by necessary union of hroa (body) and fëa (WJ:405). In Airëfëa noun "the Holy Spirit", Fëanáro masc. name "Spirit of Fire" (Quenya-Sindarin hybrid form: Fëanor), Fëanturi noun "Masters of Spirits", name of the two Valar Mandos and Lórien (SA:tur), fëafelmë noun "spirit-impulse" (impulses originating with the spirit, e.g. love, pity, anger, hate) (VT41:19 cf. 13, VT43:37). In one source it is said to mean specifically a “spirit indwelling a body”, i.e. “soul” (PE17:124), which contradicts such uses as Airefëa or Fëanturi. Cf. fairë.
	fëalócë ("k") noun "spark-dragon" (LOK)
	Fëanáro masc. name "Spirit of Fire", in Sindarized form Fëanor (SA:nár, PHAY, MR:206). The word apparently includes the masculine ending -o. Compare fëa, nár.
	#fel-, see felmë
	felca, see felco
	felco noun “cave, mine, underground dwelling” (PE17:118); also felca, felehta
	felehta, see felco
	felya noun "cave" (PHÉLEG),  “mine, boring, tunnel, underground dwel[ling]” (PE17:118)
	felmë noun "impulse, emotion" (VT41:19; this suggests a verb #fel- "to feel"). Compounded in fëafelmë, hroafelmë.
	felu noun “bad magic” (QL:38)
fen (feng-) noun "reed" (QL:38, stem feng- also in GL:34). 
	fenda noun "threshold" (PHEN)
	fenna noun “door” (PE17:45, 181)
fenumë noun "dragon" (LT2:341 – but lócë is the normal word in LotR-style Quenya)
	feren (stem fern-, as in pl. ferni) noun "beech, beech-tree". Also fernë. (BERÉTH, PHER/PHÉREN)
	férima, also ferina, adj. “ready to hand, (quickly) available” (PE17:181)
	ferinya adj. "beechen" (PHER/PHÉREN)
	ferna noun "mast, beechnuts" (PHER/PHÉREN)
	fernë noun "beech-tree" (pl. ferni given). Also feren. (PHER/PHÉREN)
	ferya- vb. “make ready (promptly)” (PE17:181)
	feuya- verb "feel disgust at, abhor" (PHEW, VT46:9)
	fifíru- vb.; this is evidently the frequentative (see sisíla-) form of fir-; according to MC:223 it means "slowly fade away"; participle fifírula in Markirya (translated "fading")
	filit (filic- ("k"), as in pl. filici) noun "small bird" (PHILIK)
	*fimbë (stem fimbi-) adj. “slender” (PE17:23)
	finca adj. “clever” (in petty ways) (PE17:119). A distinct form finca is also mentioned as the cognate of Sindarin fineg, but neither form is clearly glossed. The word-group under consideration has to do with hair (PE17:17).
	finda (1) adj. "having hair, -haired" (Tolkien's gloss "-haired" evidently means that finda may be used in compounds, like *carnifinda "red-haired") (PM:340)
	finda (2) adj. “fine & delicately made” (PE17:181)
	Findaráto masc. name *"Hair-champion", Sindarized as Finrod (SA:ar(a) )
	findë (1) noun "hair" (especially of the head) (PM:340), "a tress or plait of hair" (PM:345), "tress, braid of hair, lock of hair" (SPIN) 
findë (2) noun? (less likely adj.) "cunning" (LT1:253; this "Qenya" word is possibly obsoleted by # 1 above)
	Findecáno ("-káno") masc. name *"Hair-commander"; Sindarized as Fingon (PM:344)
	findel adj. “having beautiful hair” (PE17:119); it is possible that this is intended as Sindarin.
	findelë noun “tress, lock” (PE17:119); apparently a synonym of findë #1, q.v.
	findessë noun "a head of hair, a person's hair as a whole" (PM:345). Compare findilë.
	findilë noun “a head of hair”. Compare findessë. (PE17:17)
	findl noun "lock of hair, tress" (but findil elsewhere – in LotR-style Quenya, no word can end in -dl). (LT2:341)
	finë (1) (stem *fini-, given the primitive form ¤phini) noun "a hair" (PM:340, PE17:17) or "larch" (SPIN)
	finë (2) noun “dexterity” (PE17:119, related to words for skill)
	fínëa adj. “dexterous” (PE17:119), also finwa, q.v.
	finië noun? "cunning" (LT1:253)
	finta- (1) vb. “to make, finish off, or decorate a thing with delicate work” (PE17:17)

	#fintalë noun “trick”, given as pl. fintaler (PE17:119)
	finwa adj. “dexterous; ‘clever’, fine, delicate” (PE17:119, 181), a similar word is glossed "sagacious" in very early material (LT1:253)
	Finwë masc. name, apparently displaying the frequent ending -wë suffixed to a stem normally having to do with hair, but the name is obscure (see Tolkien's discussion in PM:340-341). Also in Etym (PHIN, WEG). According to VT46:9, Finwë was also the name of tengwa #10 in the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, but Tolkien would later call #10 formen instead.
	finya (1) also leptafinya, adj. “clever(-fingered)” (PE17:17)
	finya- (2) vb. ”to do a thing / make a thing (with fine work)” (PE17:181)
	fion (1) (fiond- or simply fion-, as in pl. fiondi or fioni) noun ?"hawk" (reading of gloss uncertain; according to Christopher Tolkien the most natural interpretation would be "haste", but this word would have no plural form) (PHI, VT46:9). 
	fion (2) “bowl, goblet” (LT1:253)
	Fionwë masc. name; a Maia; also called Eönwë, q.v. (PHI, (WEG) )
	fir- vb. "die, fade" (cf. fifíru-); aorist (?) fírë "expire"; augmentless perfect fírië, translated "she has breathed forth" (but no explicit element meaning "she" seems to be present) (MR:250, 470, VT43:34)
	firië noun "dying, death" (gerund of fir-) (VT43:34)
	firë noun "mortal man" (PHIR), pl. firi given (the latter is not clearly glossed and may also be the archaic form from which firë is derived, since word-final short *i became e in Quenya – but since we would rather expect the spelling *phiri if it were an archaic form, it is best taken as the pl. of firë.)
	Fíriel fem. name "She that sighed" or "She that died", later name of Míriel (MR:250) 
	fírima adj. "mortal" (PHIR; firima with a short i in VT46:4); also used as noun: Fírima pl. Fírimar "those apt to die", "mortals", an Elvish name of Mortal Men (WJ:387). This adj. is also the source of an explicit noun, personalized #Fírimo = mortal, mortal man. Pl. Fírimor (VT49:10-11), dative pl. fírimoin "for men" in Fíriel's Song; cf. also the pl. allative fírimonnar in VT44:35. 
	#Fírimo noun “mortal”, see fírima
	firin adj. "dead" (by natural cause) (PHIR). This may obsolete the earlier "Qenya" word firin "ray of the sun" (LT2:341)
firinga noun "carcanet, necklace" (LT2:346, GL:36)
	Firya pl. Firyar noun "Mortals", an Elvish name of Mortal Men (WJ:387). Etym has firya "human", literally *"mortal" (PHIR)
	Firyanor place-name, other name of Hildórien, the place where mortal men first awoke, like the Elves did at Cuiviénen (PHIR)
	fó interjection “nay, no”; the stem √PHŌ/Ū is itself defined as an “interjection of displeasure/dissent” (PE17:181)

	fólë noun "secrecy, a secret" (LT2:340; "Qenya" spelling fôlë)
	fólima adj. "secretive" (LT2:340; "Qenya" spelling fôlima)

 	forma noun "right hand" (VT47:6). Compare formaitë, forya.
	formaitë adj. "righthanded, dexterous" (PHOR, VT49:9, 31). Compare ataformaitë.

	formenya adj. "northern" (PHOR)
	forna adj. “northern” (PE17:18)
	Forolondië (also shortened and assimilated Follondië) place-name “North-harbourage”, old name for Arnor, in full Turmen Follondiéva “Realm of the North-harbourage” (PE17:28). Compare Hyaralondië. 
	Forostar place-name, the "Northlands" of Númenor (UT:165)
	fortë (stem *forti- given the primitive form ¤phoroti) adj. "northern" (PHOR)
	forya adj. "right" (PHOR), "dexter" (VT46:10)
	Fui noun "Night" (PHUY) - variant Hui, which form is probably to be preferred in light of Tolkien's later insight that the related word fuinë (see below) is actually Telerin, the proper Quenya form being huinë.
	fuinë noun "deep shadow" (PHUY; cf. "Qenya" fuin "night" in MC:221). According to VT41:8, fuinë is not a Quenya form at all, but Telerin for Quenya huinë (but unquestionably, fuinë is quoted as a Quenya form in certain earlier sources; cf. also Fuinur below - perhaps we may assume that fuinë was borrowed into Quenya from Telerin and thus came to co-exist with huinë?
	Fuinur (misprint "Fuinar" in the Silmarillion Index) masc. name, evidently derived from fuinë "shadow" (Silm; cf. the stem PHUY in the Etymologies)
	fúmë noun "sleep" (LT1:253). Read perhaps *húmë in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya, since Tolkien later decided that fu- tended to become hu-.
	fúmella noun "poppy" (also fúmellot) (LT1:253). Read perhaps *húmella in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya, since Tolkien later decided that fu- tended to become hu-.
	fúmellot noun "poppy" (also fúmella) (LT1:253)  Read perhaps *húmellot in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya, since Tolkien later decided that fu- tended to become hu-.
	#funda- stem of uncertain meaning occurring in a “Qenya” text, but possibly meaning “thunder” (see the comments of the editor in PE16:59). If the word survived (in Tolkien’s conception), it would appear as *hunda- in Third Age Quenya, since Tolkien decided that fu- tended to become hu-. This could result in such words as *hunda- vb. “to thunder”, gerund *hundië (which could then express “thunder, thundering” as a noun). 
	fur- vb. "to conceal, to lie" (LT2:340) Read perhaps *hur- in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya, since Tolkien decided that fu- tended to become hu-.
	furin adj. "hidden, concealed" (also hurin, which form may be preferred in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya) (LT2:340)
furu noun "a lie" (LT2:340, GL:36) Read perhaps *huru in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya, since Tolkien decided that fu- tended to become hu-.

<H>
haca- vb. "squat" (GL:47)
	hácala ("k") participle "yawning" occurring in the Markirya poem, derived from an (otherwise unattested) verb #hac- "yawn". Compare yanga-.
hacca noun "buttocks, hams" (GL:47)
	hahta noun "pile, mound" (KHAG)
	haimë noun "habit" (KHIM)
	haira adj. "remote, far" (KHAYA)
	haiya adj. "far" (SD:247). Also háya.
	hala (1) noun "(small) fish" (KHAL1, SKAL2, VT45:20)
	hala (2) noun ”a cast shadow” (PE17:184)
	halatir (halatirn-, as in dat.sg. halatirnen), also halatirno, noun "kingsfisher", etymologically "fish-watcher" (TIR, SKAL2, KHAL1)
	halcin ("k") adj. "frozen" (LT1:254)
	halda adj. "veiled, hidden, shadowed, shady" (opposed to helda "stripped bare") (SKAL1, VT46:13)
	halla (1) adj. "tall" (Appendix E, footnote)
	[halla (2) adj. "naked" (VT46:14), changed by Tolkien to helda]
	Hallacar masc. name, apparently "tall helmet": halla + car (cf. Eldacar for the latter element) (UT:210)
	Hallatan masc. name, apparently "tall man": halla + atan (UT:210)
	[halma], see helma
	haloisi noun "the sea (in storm)", cf. haloitë (LT1:254)
	haloitë adj. "leaping" (LT1:254)
	halta- vb. "to leap" (LT1:254)
halya- vb. "veil, conceal, screen from light" (SKAL1, VT46:13) Tolkien noted that “√SKAL applied to more opaque things that cut off light and cast shadows over other things” (PE17:184), contrasting it with √SPAN, the rejected stem of fanta-, q.v.
	ham- (1) vb. "sit" (KHAM)
#ham- (2) vb. "judge", attested in the aorist form hamil "you judge". (VT42:33; notice the pronominal ending -l "you". See nemë. The verb #ham- with the meaning "judge" may seem to be an ephemeral form in Tolkien's conception.)
hamma noun "chair" (VT45:20)
hampa adj. “restrained, delayed, kept” (PE17:68)
	han prep. "beyond" (compare the postposition pella of similar meaning) (VT43:14)
	[hanaco ("k") noun "giant" (VT45:21)]
	handa (1) adj. "understanding, intelligent" (KHAN)
	[?handa] (2) noun "chair"; the reading is uncertain and the word was in any case deleted (VT45:20). In the Etymologies, Tolkien likewise abandoned the root KHAD from which this word was derived, but he may seem to have restored this root later (see har-).
	handassë noun "intelligence" (KHAN)
	handë noun "knowledge, understanding, intelligence" (KHAN). Note: *handë is (probably) also the past tense of the verb har- "sit".
	handelë noun "intellect" (another gloss, "intelligence", Tolkien transferred to handassë) (KHAN, VT45:21)
	[hando] noun "agent" (male; fem. [yendi]) (VT45:16)
	háno noun "brother", colloquially also hanno (VT47:12, 14). It is unclear whether Tolkien, by introducing this form, abandoned the older (TLT) word toron (q.v.)
	hanno noun "brother" (a colloquial form, cf. háno), also used in children's play for "middle finger" (VT47:12, 14, VT48:4, 6)
	hanquenta vb.? noun? “answer” (PE17:176) 
	hantalë noun "thanksgiving", isolated from Eruhantalë (UT:166; see also VT43:14). A verbal stem #hanta- "thank, give thanks" may apparently be isolated from this word.
	hantë, pa.t. of hat-, q.v. (SKAT)
	hanu noun "a male (of Men or Elves), male animal, man" (3AN, VT45:16)
	hanuvoitë adj.? "male" (prob. adj. rather than noun; the word as such is not clearly glossed, but connects with hanu "a male") (INI)
	hanwa noun "male" (INI)
	hanya- vb. "understand, know about, be skilled in dealing with" (KHAN, VT45:21)
	har, harë adj.? adv.? "near" (LT1:253)
	har- vb. "sit, stay", pl. present hárar in CO (i hárar "those who sit, those who are sitting"). Imperative hara in the phrase (hara) máriessë “(stay) in happiness” (PE17:162). According to VT45:20, har- "sit" is derived from a stem KHAD which Tolkien abandoned in the Etymologies, but since CO is later than Etym, he may seem to have restored KHAD. If so, the past tense of har- would be *handë.
haran (#harn-, as in pl. harni) noun "king, chieftain" (3AR, TĀ/TA3, VT45:17; for "king", the word aran is to be preferred in LotR-style Quenya). In a deleted entry in the Etymologies, haran was glossed "chief" (VT45:17)
	haranyë noun, last year of a century in the Númenórean calendar (or possibly the word for "century" itself; Tolkien's wording is unclear) (Appendix D)
	harda noun "realm, region" (VT45:12, 16, 17; the word also occurs, unglossed, in the entry EN in the Etymologies). Changed to arda later?
	*harin adj. “marred” (PE17:150). The word is given as χarin, where the initial Greek chi presumably represents [x]; in later [MET] pronunciation and spelling, this would become *harin. 
	harma (1) noun "treasure, a treasured thing" (3AR), also name of tengwa #11, later (MET) called aha (Appendix E). 
	[harma (2) noun "wolf" (3ARAM). The gloss "hound" was inserted, but then deleted (VT45:17)]
	[Harmen] noun "south" (MEN) (Changed to hyarmen.)
	harna (1) adj. "wounded"
harna- (2) vb. "to wound" (SKAR)
	harna (3) noun "helmet" (VT45:21)
	harpa noun "helmet" (VT45:21)
	harwë (1) noun "wound" (SKAR)
harwë (2) noun "treasure, treasury" (3AR) (For clarity, harma may be used for "treasure")
	harya- vb. "possess" (3AR)
	haryon noun "(heir), prince" (3AR). Alternative form aryon.
	#hasta- vb. "mar" (verbal stem isolated from the passive participle hastaina "marred"). (MR:254)
	hat- (1) vb. “fling” (cited as hatin “I fling”, first person sg. aorist), pa.t. hantë (QL:39). The apparently related noun hatal “spear” occurring in late material (VT49:14) suggests that Tolkien eventually decided to maintain hat- “fling”, though in the meantime, a distinct verb hat- “break asunder” had occurred in his writings.
	hat- (2) vb. "break asunder", pa.t. hantë (SKAT). Compare ascat-, terhat-. It may be that Tolkien eventually restored the verb hat- “fling” occurring in early material (see above), leaving the conceptual status of hat- “break asunder” uncertain (for “break”, late material has rac-).
	hatal noun “spear” (VT49:14, 33). Another word for “spear” is ehtë.
	hatsë noun “headlong movement” (VT49:33, QL:39)
	haura adj. “huge” (PE17:115)
	hauta- vb. "cease, take a rest, stop" (KHAW)
	háya adj. "far off, far away" (KHAYA). Also haiya.
	hé “him (the other, etc.)” in the sentence melin sé apa la hé “I love him but not him” (another) (VT49:15). It may be that hé covers both genders (“her” as well as “him”), like sé (se) is known to do.
	heca! ("k") vb. in imperative "be gone! stand aside!", also with pronominal suffixes hecat sg. (but see -t #3) and hecal pl. (WJ:364) 
	Hecel ("k") (Heceld-, e.g. pl. Heceldi, WJ:371), noun with same meaning as hecil, q.v., but reformed to match Oarel, especially applied to the Eldar left in Beleriand. Helcelmar and Heceldamar *"Land of Forsaken Elves", the name used by the loremasters of Aman for Beleriand. (WJ:365)
	hecil ("k") (masc. hecilo, fem. hecilë) noun "one lost or forsaken by friends, waif, outcast, outlaw" (WJ:365)
	hehta- (pa.t. hehtanë) vb. "put aside, leave out, exclude, abandon, forsake" (WJ:365)
	hela conj. “or”, apparently an ephemeral form, replaced by hya (VT49:14-15). The editor theorizes that hela literally meant “other than” (VT49:15)
	helca ("k") adj. "icy, ice-cold" (misprint "helk" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry KHELEK; both the Silmarillion Appendix and LT1:254 have helka, and VT45:21 finally confirmed that there is a final -a in Tolkien's Etymologies manuscript as well). In Helcar, the Inland Sea in the north-east of Middle-earth, and Helcaraxë, the Grinding Ice between Araman and Middle-earth (SA; spelt "Helkarakse" in the Etymologies, stem KARAK)
	helcë ("k") noun "ice" (KHELEK, LT1:254) 
	helcelimbë ("k") noun *"ice-drop"? (LIB1, cf. KHELEK)
	helda (1) adj. "naked, stripped bare" (SKEL, SKAL1)
	[helda (2) adj. "friendly, having love (for)" (VT46:3)]
	[heldo, also helmo, fem. heldë, noun "friend" (VT46:3)]
	[helmë noun "friendship" (VT46:3)]
	helin noun "violet" or "pansy" (LT1:262)
	Helinyetillë noun "Eyes of Heartsease", a name of the pansy (LT1:262)
	hellë noun "sky" (3EL; a distinct word hellë "frost" was struck out, see KHEL.)
	helma noun "skin, fell" (SKEL), changed by Tolkien from halma (VT46:14)
	helwa adj. "(pale) blue" (3EL)
	helyanwë noun "rainbow", lit. "sky-bridge" (3EL)
	hen (hend-, as in pl. hendi) noun "eye" (KHEN-D-E); possibly dual #hendu in hendumaica, q.v. Noun henfanwa “eye-screen, veil upon eyes” (PE17:176), adj. henulca "evileyed" (SD:68; cf. ulca).
	hendumaica ("k") noun? adj.? "sharp-eye" (read *"sharp-eyed"?) (WJ:337)
	henfanwa, see hen
	henta- vb. “to eye, to examine (with the eyes), scan; to read (silently)” (for “read aloud”, et-henta is used). Forms cited: Aorist henta, present continuative hentëa, “aorist past” hentanë, perfect ehentanië. Gerund #hentië “reading”, isolated from parmahentië “book reading” (PE17:77, 156).
	hententa- vb. “spot with eye” (direct the eye toward something) (VT49:24). Cf. tenta-, leptenta-. 
	henulca, see hen-
	hequa prep. "leaving aside, not counting, excluding, except" (WJ:365)
	hér noun "lord" (VT41:9), also heru, q.v.
	héra adj. "chief, principal" (KHER)
	hérë noun "lordship" (LT1:272)
	heren (1) noun "order"; Heren Istarion "Order of Wizards" (UT:388)
heren (2) noun "fortune", etymologically "governance" ("and so what is in store for one and what one has in store") (KHER). Herendil masc. name *"Fortune-friend" = Eadwine, Edwin, Audoin (LR:52, 56, cf. the Etymologies, stems KHER-, NIL/NDIL)
	herenya adj. "fortunate, wealthy, blessed, rich" (KHER)
	heri noun "lady" (KHER, LT1:272)
	hérincë ("k") noun *"little lady" (UT:195). Concerning the diminutive ending, cf. Atarincë, cirinci.
	heru (also hér) noun "lord, master" (PM:210, KHER, LT1:272, VT44:12); Letters:283 gives hér (heru); the form Héru with a long vowel refers to God in the source where it appears (i Héru "the Lord", VT43:29). In names like Herumor *"Black Lord" and Herunúmen "Lord of the West" (SA:heru). The form heruion is evidently a gen.pl. of heru "lord": *"of the lords" (SD:290); herunúmen "Lord-of-West" (LR:47), title of Manwë. Pl. númeheruvi "Lords-of-West" (*"West-lords") in SD:246, a title of the Valar; does this form suggest that #heruvi is the regular plural of heru?
	heru- vb. "to rule" (LT1:272; rather tur- in LotR-style Quenya)
	Hescin ("k") noun "winter one" (???) (LT1:255)
	Hesin noun "winter" (LT1:255; LotR-style Quenya has hrívë instead)
	hessa adj. "dead, withered" (LT1:255)
	hesta vb. "wither" (LT1:255)
	hesto noun "captain" (VT45:22; the word is not explictly identified as Quenya but can hardly be any other language)
	hí adv. “here” (VT49:34)
	hilcin ("k") vb., glossed "it freezes" (LT1:254); if this word is to be adapted to LotR-style Quenya, it would have to mean "I freeze", but the shape of this word seems somewhat alien to Tolkien's later forms of Quenya (verbs with 1st person aorists in -in never have a consonant cluster immediately preceding this ending)
	hildi, -hildi noun "followers" (used = mortal men, the Second-born of Ilúvatar) (KHIL) (also Hildor, q.v.). Dat. pl. hildin "for men", a dative pl. occurring in Fíriel's Song. Cf. hildinyar "my heirs", evidently *hildë, hildo "follower, heir" + -inya "my" + -r plural ending (EO) 
	Hildor pl. noun "the Followers", an Elvish name of Mortal Men as the Second-born of Ilúvatar (WJ:387); sg #Hildo. Hildórien place-name: the land where Men first awoke, like the Elves did at Cuiviénen (Silm, KHIL, PHIR)
	hilya- vb. "to follow" (KHIL)
	himba adj. "adhering, sticking" (KHIM)
	himya- vb. "to stick to, adhere, cleave to, abide by" (KHIM, VT45:22)
	hína noun "child", also hina used in the vocative to a (young) child (also hinya "my child", for hinanya) (WJ:403). Pl. híni (surprisingly not **hínar) in Híni Ilúvataro "Children of Ilúvatar" (Silmarillion Index); dative hínin in VT44:35. In compounds -hin pl. -híni (as in Eruhíni, "Children of Eru", SA:híni). According to one source, the word is hín(i) and solely plural (PE17:157), but this is obviously contradicted by some of the sources quoted above.
	hir- vb. "find", future tense hiruva in Namárië (hiruvalyë "thou shalt find") (Nam, RGEO:67, VT49:39); Hirilondë "Haven-finder", name of a ship (UT:192)
	hir (hird-), pl. hirdi, noun "entrails, bowels" (PE13:161)  
	hísë (þ) (stem #hísi- because of the primitive form ¤khīthi, cf. hísilanya, Hísilómë) (1) noun "mist, fog" (KHIS/KHITH). According to VT45:22, hísë is also the name of Tengwa #11 in the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, but Tolkien would later call #11 harma/aha instead.
hísë (2) noun "dusk" (LT1:255). A "Qenya" form possibly obsoleted by #1 above.
hísë (3) adj.? "blinking" (?) (MC:214) A "Qenya" form possibly obsoleted by #1 above.
	hísen noun in pre-classical genitive? "of mist" (þ) (MC:221; this is "Qenya", but it connects with hísë #1.)
	hísië (þ) noun "mist, mistiness" (Nam, SA:hîth, PE17:73), also hísë.
	hísilanya (þ noun “mist thread”, warp (Sindarin hithlain). Cf. hísë. –PE17:60
	Hísilómë (þ) place-name "Hithlum", “Land of Mist”, more literally *”Mist-night” (SA:hîth, LUM, [VT45:28])
	Hísilumbë (þ) place-name, variant of Hísilómë (LUM)
	Hísimë (þ) noun, eleventh month of the year, "November" (Appendix D, SA:hîth). The Quenya word seems to mean "Misty One".
	histanë pre-classical participle? "fading" (MC:213; this is "Qenya") 
	histë noun "dusk" (LT1:255)
	hiswa (þ) adj. "grey" (KHIS/KHITH, Narqelion)
	hiswë (þ) noun "fog" (KHIS/KHITH)
	hiuta- vb. "wink, hint" (VT46:6)
	hlaiwa, see laiwa
	hlapu- verb "blow; fly or stream in the wind", participle hlápula "blowing" in Markirya
	hlar- verb "hear", future tense hlaruva "shall hear" in Markirya. Since the original root is SLAS, this verb may have the past tense *hlassë (for slansē) in more classical forms of Quenya, perhaps re-formed as *hlarnë (or *hlarrë, for hlazze) in spoken Noldorin Quenya. Compare #hriz- “snow” (root SRIS) with past tense hrinsë/hrissë, as well as Tolkien's remarks in PE19:99.
	hlas noun “ear”, stem hlar- as in the dual form hlaru (PE17:62). Compare lár #2.

hloa ("hloä"), noun that "would have been" the product of primitive ¤sloga (Sindarin lhô), a word used of rivers that were "variable and liable to overflow their banks at seasons". However, the wording "would have been" may seem to suggest that this word did not actually occur in Quenya. (VT42:9)
	hlócë ("k") noun "snake, serpent", later lócë ("k") (SA:lok-)
	hloima noun ”poison”, ”a poisonous substance” (PE17:185)
	hloirë noun “venom, poison, poisonousness” (PE17:185)
	hloirëa adj. “venomous” (PE17:185)
	hloita- vb. “to poison, envenom, fill with poison” (PE17:185)
	hlón noun "sound", "a noise" (VT48:29). Also hlóna. The stem of hlón is apparently hlon- if hloni "sounds" in WJ:394 is its plural form. 
	hlóna (1) noun "a noise" (VT48:29, PE17:138). Also hlón.
	[hlóna (2) noun "a river, especially given to those at all seasons full of water from mountains" (VT48:27; the word is marked with a query and the note containing it rejected; it was apparently replaced by lón, q.v.)]
	hlonitë adj. "phonetic", apparently a close variant of hlónítë below (VT48:29, PE17:138)
	#hlonítë adj. "phonetic", only attested in the pl. in the phrase hloníti tengwi "phonetic signs" (sg. #hlonítë tengwë) (WJ:395). The sg. form hlonitë with a short i occurs in VT48:29 and PE17:138. The form #hlonítë was changed by Tolkien from hlonaitë, as in hlonaitë tengwesta "a tengwesta [q.v.] employing phonetic signs" (VT39:4), hlonaiti tengwi "phonetic signs" (VT39:4). 
	hlussa-, hlussë; see lussa-, lustë
	ho prep. "from" (3O); cf. hó-
	hó- verbal prefix; "away, from, from among", the point of view being outside the thing, place, or group in thought (WJ:368)
	hoa (“höa”) adj. “big, large” (PE17:115)
	hóciri- vb. "cut off" (cut of a required portion, so as to have it or use it) (WJ:366, 368) (Normal aorist probably *hócirë, present/continuative tense *hócíra, past tense *hócirnë) 
	[holmë] noun "odour" (ÑOL; according to VT46:6, Tolkien struck out the initial h-, thus changing the word to olmë)
	holya, also holta-, vb. “shut, close” (PE17:98)  
	holwë noun "stink" (or *"stench"), *holwëa adj. "stinking". PE13:162 gives holwë "stink", derived from 3olwē; PM13:145 however gives the Q word as olwë and the adj. "stinking" as olwëa, though primitive forms with initial 3- (the spirant gh) are presupposed also there. Tolkien later used a system where primitive words in 3- yield Quenya forms in h-, as demonstrated by relevant entries in the Etymologies, so we prefer holwë to olwë (which would also clash with the later personal name Olwë, unlikely to mean "stink"), and we similarly read *holwëa rather than olwëa as the adj. "stinking". – In Etym, the root ÑOL seems to represent a later experiment with similar words having to do with smell, and once again we observe shifting conceptions as to whether the Quenya words should show initial h- or not; in this conception the initial consonant in Primitive Elvish was ñ- rather than 3-.
	hó noun “spirit, shadow” (PE17:86)
	hón noun "heart" (physical) (KHŌ-N); hon-maren "heart of the house", a fire (LR:63, 73; this is "Qenya" with genitive in -en, not -o as in LotR-style Quenya – read *hon-maro?) 
	hondo-ninya noun "my heart", changed to indo-ninya (FS, earlier version)
	hópa noun "haven, harbour, small landlocked bay" (KHOP)
	hopan, see hopassë
	hopassë noun "harbourage", changed by Tolkien from hopan (KHOP, VT45:22)
	hórë noun "impulse" (KHOR), hórëa "impulsive" (KHOR; VT45:22 confirms that "impulsive" is the correct gloss, misread "impulsion" in the Etymologies as printed in LR)
	horma noun "horde, host" (LT2:341)
	hormë noun "urgency" (confused with ormë "rushing") (KHOR; originally glossed "encouragement, comfort", VT45:22)
	horro (also orro) interjection "ugh, alas! ow!" (said to be an interjection "of horror, pain, disgust") (VT45:17)
	horta- vb. "send flying, speed, urge" (KHOR; originally glossed "urge, encourage", VT45:22)
	hortalë noun "speeding, urging" (KHOR)
	horya- noun "have an impulse, be compelled to do something, set vigorously out to do" (VT45:22)
	hos noun "folk" (LT2:340)
	hossë noun "army, band, troop" (LT2:340)
	hosta- vb. "gather, collect, assemble" (Markirya), “gather hastily together, pile up” (PE17:39), hostainiéva "will be gathered", future tense of the stative verb *hostainië, derived from *hostaina "gathered", past participle of hosta- "gather". Such stative verbs are probably not conceptually valid in Tolkien's later Quenya; see -ië. (FS)
	hosta noun "large number", verb hosta- "to collect" (KHOTH)
	hostar noun "tribe" (LT2:340)
	hrá, see rá
	hrai- prefix denoting difficulty (PE17:154, 185), cf. ur(u)- 
	hraia adj. “awkward, difficult” (PE17:154), ephemerally meant “easy” (PE17:172)
	hraicénima adj. “scarcely visible, hard to see” (PE17:154). Also hraicenë.
	hranga- (1) vb. “thwart” (said to be a weak verb) (PE17:154)
	hranga (2) adj. “awkward, hard” (PE17:154), “stiff, awkward, difficult” (PE17:185)
	hráva adj. “wild” (PE17:78); see ráva #1.
	hravan noun “wild beast”; pl. Hravani "the Wild", used as a name of non-Edain Men (PE17:78, WJ:219). PE17:18 has Hrávani with a long á, glossed “Wild-men, Savages”.
	hrávë noun "flesh" (MR:349)
	hresta noun "shore, beach", ablative hrestallo *"from (the) shore" in Markirya
	*hrir- vb. likely Third Age form of hriz-, q.v.
	hrissë noun “fall of snow” (PE17:168), possibly also the past tense of #hriz-, q.v.
	hristil noun “snow [?peak]” (PE17:168)
	Hristo noun "Christ", Tolkien's phonological adaptation of this word to Quenya (VT44:18; also Hrísto with a long vowel, VT44:15-16)
	[hrisya- < hriþya vb. “it snows”, pa.t. hrintë or hrisinyë (PE17:168). Tolkien replaced this verb by #hriz-, q.v.]
	hrívë noun "winter", in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 72 days, but also used without any exact definition (Appendix D). Yá hrívë tenë, ringa ná “when winter comes (arrives, is with us), it is cold” (VT49:23; Tolkien changed tenë to menë, p. 24). – The word Hrívion, heading a section of the poem The Trees of Kortirion that has to do with the “fading time”, would seem to be related (LT1:42)
	#hriz- vb. “to snow”, impersonal, given in the form hríza “it is snowing”. Normally z would turn to r in Exilic Quenya, but since two r's close to one another were disliked, it may be that hriz- became *hris- instead (compare razë “sticks out” becoming rasë instead of **rarë, PE19:73) Past tense hrinsë (with s from the original root SRIS) and another form which the editor tentatively reads as hrissë (the development ns > ss is regular). (PE17:168)
	hroa (sometimes spelt "hröa") noun "body" (changed by Tolkien from hrondo, in turn changed from hrón). The word hroa comes from earlier ¤srawa (VT47:35). Pl. hroar is attested (MR:304, VT39:30). In MR:330, Tolkien notes that hroa is "roughly but not exactly equivalent to 'body' " (as opposed to "soul"). The Incarnates live by necessary union of hroa (body) and fëa (soul) (WJ:405). Hroafelmë "body-impulse" (impulses provided by the body, e.g. physical fear, hunger, thirst, sexual desire) (VT41:19 cf. 13)
	Hróatani noun *“Eastern Men”  (PE17:18), as opposed to the Núnatani (Dúnedain, Westmen). 
	hrómen noun “east”, variant of the more common Rómen, q.v. (PE17:18)
	hrón noun “flesh/substance of Arda”, “matter” (PE17:183), also at one point used = hroa “body”, q.v. Compare erma. 
	hrondo noun “a corporeal form or body (especially of the Elves)” (PE17:183). Tolkien replaced this word by hroa, q.v.
	hróna adj. “eastern” (PE17:18), apparently a variant of róna, q.v. (itself not clearly glossed). 
	hróta noun "dwelling underground, artificial cave or rockhewn hall" (PM:365)
	hróva adj. “dark, dark brown”, used to refer to hair (PE17:154)
	hru-, hrú, ru- prefix implying wickedness or evil, only occasionally used, e.g. hrúcarë, q.v.
	hrúcarë, also rúcarë, noun “evil-doing” (PE17:170)
	hruo noun “troll” (PE17:115)
	hú noun “hound” (PE17:86), cf. huan, huo
	[hu- or hú-, negative prefix (VT45:17); Tolkien settled on ú- instead.]
	huan (hún-, as in dat. sg. húnen) noun "hound" (KHUGAN, KHUG). Cf. hú, huo.
	huë “Qenya” cardinal “nine” (in Tolkien’s later Quenya nertë) (VT49:54)
	Hui noun "Night" (PHUY), in earlier "Qenya" defined as "evening" (MC:214) or "fog, dark, murk, night" (LT1:253).
	huinë noun "deep shadow" (PHUY), "gloom" (VT41:8), "gloom, darkness" (SA:fuin), also used for "shadow" = Sauron (LR:56). Possessive (adjectival) form huinéva in the name Taurë Huinéva, q.v. In earlier sources, huinë is quoted as a variant of fuinë, but according to VT41:8, huinë is the proper Quenya form and fuinë is Telerin. With prefix nu- "under" and allative ending -nna in nuhuinenna (SD:246); also unuhuinë "under-shadow" (LR:47).
	huiva adj. "murky" (LT1:253)
	[#hum- vb. "not to do" (cited as 1st person aorist: humin "I do not"; pa.t. húmë. (VT45:17). See #um-.]
	húmë (1) numeral "thousand" (PE13:50). Pl. húmi is attested (used in connection with other numbers, as in "two thousand", i.e. "two thousands").
	*húmë (2), see fúmë 
	húna 1) adj. “cursed, accursed”. Cf. húta-. (PE17:149)

	hurin adj. "hidden, concealed" (also furin) (LT2:340)
	húro noun "storm" (MC:214; this is "Qenya")
	huru, see furu
	húta- vb. “curse”, pa.t. huntë or huntanë. It is unclear whether the word húna “cursed, accursed” should be regarded as the passive participle of this verb, or only as an independent (though obviously related) adjective. (PE17:149)
	[húvanimor, see úvanimo]
	hwan (hwand-, e.g. pl. hwandi) noun "sponge, fungus" (SWAD)
	hwarin adj. "crooked" (SKWAR)
	hwarma noun "crossbar" (SKWAR)

hwesta- (2) vb. "to puff" (SWES)
hwindë (1) noun “birch” (PE17:23)
	hwindë noun (2) "eddy, whirlpool" (SWIN). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, hwindë was also the name of tengwa #34, which letter Tolkien would later call hwesta sindarinwa instead.

	hyá adv.? "here by us" (Narqelion, QL:xiv)
 	hyalin noun “paper” (PE16:133)
	Hyallondië, see Hyaralondië
	hyalma noun "shell, conch, horn of Ulmo" (SYAL). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, hyalma was also the name of tengwa #33 (VT46:16), which letter Tolkien would later call hyarmen instead.
	#hyam- vb. "pray" (aorist hyamë attested, VT43:34)
	hyan- vb. “to injure” (PE16:145)
	hyana adj. “other”, cf. hya (VT49:14)
	hyanda noun "blade, share" (LT2:342)
	*hyandë, see hyar-
	hyapat noun "shoe" (SKYAP; in the Etymologies as printed in LR the gloss appears as "shore", but according to http://www.elvish.org/errata/VT-Errata.pdf this was a misreading of Tolkien's manuscript)
	hyar noun "plough" (LT2:342)
	#hyar- vb. "cleave" (1st pers. aorist hyarin "I cleave") (SYAD). Pa.t. probably *hyandë since the R of hyar- was originally D; cf. rer- "sow", pa.t. rendë, from the root RED.
	Hyaralondië (also shortened and assimilated Hyallondië) place-name “South-harbourage”, old name for Gondor, in full Turmen Hyallondiéva “Realm of the South-harbourage” (PE17:28). Compare Forolondië. 
	Hyarastorni place-name, region in Númenor, apparently including hyar- "south" and perhaps orni "trees" (UT:210)
	hyárë noun used as adv. (older hyázë) "this day", a form Tolkien apparently abandoned in favour of síra, q.v. (VT43:18)
	hyarma noun "left hand" (VT47:6, VT49:12). Compare hyarmaitë, hyarya. Once with definite article directly prefixed (ihyarma, VT49:22), but i hyarma in other versions of the same text.
	hyarmaitë adj. "lefthanded" (KHYAR)
	hyarmen, Hyarmen noun "south" (SA, SA:men, KHYAR), literally “lefthand-direction” (VT49:12), since the Elves named the directions as they were to a person facing the Blessed Realm in the West  Also name of tengwa #33 (Appendix E). In Hyarmendacil masc.name, "South-victor" (Appendix A), apparently also in the place-name Hyarmentir (name of a mountain; the element -tir means *"watch[ing point]".) (SA) Hyarnustar "the Southwestlands" of Númenor; Hyarrostar the "Southeastlands" (UT:165)
	hyarmenya adj. "southern" (KHYAR)
	hyarna adj. “southern” (PE17:18)
	hyarya adj. "left" (opposite of right). (KHYAR). Compare hyarma.
	hyatsë noun "cleft, gash" (SYAD), apparently changed by Tolkien from hyassë (VT46:16)
	hye noun “other person”, also used as a pronoun of “a 3rd person entering account [who is] not subject of the original verb” (VT49:15). This hye may then also be used as subject to in a following sentence, as in Tolkien’s example “he [se] struck him [hye] and he [hye] fled” (VT49:15).
	hyellë noun "glass" (KHYEL(ES), VT45:23; the later source also provides the unglossed form hyelma, which may be a synonym of hyellë; alternatively hyellë could be "glass" as a substance, whereas hyelma rather refers to "a glass" as a drinking vessel). In later sources, cilin or calca is given as the word for "glass".
	hyelma, see hyellë
	hyóla noun "trump" (SD:419)

<I>
i (1) "the", indeclinable definite article (I, Nam, RGEO:67, Markirya, WJ:369, WJ:398, MC:215, 216, 221). A variant in (q.v.) is also attested. Hyphenated i- in i-mar "the earth" (FS), i-Ciryamo "the mariner's" (UT:8), i-aldar *"the trees" (Narqelion), attached with a dot in i·yulmar *"the cups" (VT48:11), I·Eldanyárë "the History of the Elves" (LR:199), i·arya *“the best” (PE17:57), directly prefixed with no hyphen or dot in icilyanna = i cilyanna in SD:247, also ihyarma “the left hand” in VT49:22 (but i hyarma in other versions of the same text).
 i (2) relative pronoun "(the one/they) who; (that) which" (both article and relative pronoun in CO: i Eru i or ilyë mahalmar ëa: the One who is above all thrones", i hárar "(they) who are sitting"); cf. also the phrase i hamil mára "(that) which you deem good" (VT42:33). Notice that before a verb, i means "the one who", or, in the case of a plural verb, "those who"; e.g. i carir quettar ómainen "those who form words with voices" (WJ:391). According to VT47:21, i as a relative pronoun is the personal plural form (corresponding to the personal sg. ye and the impersonal sg. ya). This agrees with the example i carir..., but as is evident from the other examples listed above, Tolkien in certain texts also used i as a singular relative pronoun, both personal (Eru i...) and impersonal (i hamil). In the sense of a plural personal relative pronoun, i is also attested in the genitive (ion) and ablative (illon) cases, demonstrating that unlike the indeclinable article i, the relative pronoun i can receive case endings. Both are translated "from whom": ion  / illon camnelyes "from whom you received it" (referring to several persons) (VT47:21).
i (3) conj. “that”. Savin Elessar ar i nánë aran Ondórëo “I believe that Elessar really existed and that [he] was a king of Gondor” (VT49:27), savin…i E[lesarno] quetië naitë *”I believe that Elessar’s speaking [is] true” (VT49:28)  Also cf. nai, nái “be it that” (see nai #1), which may seem to incorporate this conjunction.
	-i nominative plural ending regularly used on nouns ending in a consonant and in -ë; in the latter case, -ë is displaced (e.g. Quendë pl. Quendi).
	[ia adv. "ever" (GEY, EY); replaced by oia.]
	[ialë noun "everlasting age" (GEY; the word "age" dropped out in the Etymologies as printed in LR; see VT45:14. Replaced by oialë.]
	-ië (1) infinitive (or gerundial) ending, “general infinitive” (PE17:68), attested in carië (see car-), enyalië, q.v. (CO)
	-ië (2) abstract ending, often used to derive abstracts from adjectives, e.g. látië “openness” vs. láta “open”, mornië “darkness” vs. morna “black, dark”, vanië (for *vanyië) “beauty” vs. vanya “fair”. 
	-ië (3) "is", -ier "are", stative verb suffix occurring in Fíriel's Song: númessier "they are in the west", meldielto "they are...beloved", talantië "he is fallen", márië "it is good" (< *númessë "in the west", melda "beloved", *talanta "fallen"); future tense -iéva in hostainiéva "will be gathered" (< *hostaina "gathered"). Compare ye "is", yéva "will be", verbs that also occur in Fíriel's Song. This suffix is probably not valid in LotR-style Quenya: -ië is an infinitival or gerundial ending in CO, for ye "is" Namárië has ná, and the phrase "lost is" is vanwa ná, not *vanwië.
	-iel patronymic/matronymic ending -"daughter" (YEL, VT46:22-23) In the Etymologies, Tolkien struck out this ending and the corresponding independent word yeldë "daughter", changing them to -ien, yendë. However, the ending -iel later turns up in later forms: Uinéniel "Daughter of Uinen" in UT:182 and Elerondiel “daughter of Elrond” (Elerondo) in PE17:56. Hence it would seem that Tolkien changed his mind again and restored this ending, and perhaps the noun yeldë along with it. – The form Elerondiel (from Elerondo) demonstrates that a final vowel is omitted before -iel.
	-ien fem. ending in certain names like Yávien, Silmarien (q.v.) At one point -ien implied "daughter", see -iel above.
	ier prep. "as" (VT43:16, probably rejected in favour of sívë, q.v.). In an abandoned version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer, Tolkien used ier...ter for "as...so" (VT43:17).
	il- (prefix) "no, *un-" (LA); cf. ilfirin "immortal" (vs. firin "dead"). This prefix "denotes the opposite, the reversal, i.e. more than the mere negation" (VT42:32). But il- can also mean "all, every"; see ilaurëa, ilqua, ilquen.
	ilaurëa adj. "daily", "of every day" (il- "every" + aurë "day" + -a adjectival ending) (VT43:18). 
	ilca- ("k") vb. "gleam (white)", participle ilcala with pl. allative ending ilcalannar in Markirya (axor ilcalannar "on bones gleaming")
	ilcë (“k”) (1) noun “appearance” (etymologically “glint”; cf. ilca-) (QL:42)
	ilcë (“k”) (2) *“you”, emphatic pronoun of the 2nd person pl. familiar, apparently a form abandoned by Tolkien. An alternative form incë was also listed; a query appears between the forms (VT49:48).
	[-ilco (“k”) *“you (two)”, abandoned pronominal ending for the familiar 2nd person dual; in later sources the relevant ending is rather -stë (VT49:48). The ending -ilco was apparently changed from -ilto (VT49:49). Compare -illo.]
	Ilcorin ("k") noun *"not of Kor", describing Elves not of the Blessed Realm; variant of Alcorin (LA, AR2, VT45:5)
	ílë noun "star" (LT1:269; rather elen, él in LotR-style Quenya.)
	ilfirin adj. "immortal" (PHIR)
	ilin adj. "pale blue" (GLINDI)
	illi noun "all" (as independent noun, apparently treated as a plural form). Imb' illi "among all" (VT47:30)
	[-illo “you (two)”, abandoned promoninal ending for the polite 2nd person dual; in later sources the relevant ending is rather -stë (VT49:48). This -illo was changed from -llo. Compare -ilco.]
	illon pl. relative pron. in ablative: "from whom", pl. (VT47:11). See i #2 (relative pronoun).
	Illuin place-name, name of one of the Lamps of the Valar; apparently incorporating the element luin "blue" (Silm): hence *“all-blue”? 
	illumë adv. "always" (VT44:9)
	ilm- stem appearing in Ilmen, the region above the air where the stars are, in Ilmarë, name of a Maia, and in Ilmarin "mansion of the high airs", the dwelling of Manwë and Varda upon Oiolossë (SA)

	*ilpirin (hypothetical form; the word actually appears in Q as ilfirin) adj. "immortal" (PHIR)
	ilqua ("ilqa") noun "everything" (IL, VT45:24), "all" (FS); ilquainen ("ilqainen") a word occurring in Fíriel's Song, translated "to all". It would appear to be ilqua "all" with a dative pl. ending. However, in Tolkien's later Quenya -inen is the ending for instrumental pl. (FS)
	ilquen noun "everybody" (WJ:372)
	ilsa noun "(the mystic name of) silver" (LT1:255, LT1:268)

	Ilúvatar masc. name "All-father", God (SD:401, FS, IL; Ilúv-atar, ATA, Iluvatar with a short u, SD:346). Often in combination with the divine name as Eru Ilúvatar, "Eru Allfather", cf. MR:112. "Qenya" genitive Ilúvatáren "of Ilúvatar" in Fíriel's Song, LR:47 and SD:246, the genitive ending is -en instead of -o as in LotR-style Quenya. Cf. the later genitive Ilúvataro in the phrase Híni Ilúvataro (see "Children of Ilúvatar" in the Silmarillion Index)
	ilúvë noun "allness, the all". In Ilúvatar "All-father". (SA; WJ:402, MR:471, IL) In MR:355, ilúvë seems to be equated with Heaven. Cf. SD:401: Ilúvë Ilu "Heaven, the universe, all that is (with and without the Earth)".

	ilwë noun "sky, heavens" (LT1:255), "the middle air among the stars" (LT1:273). – VT49:51, 53 also mentions an obscure prononominal element ilwë. 
Ilweran, Ilweranta noun "rainbow" (GL:74) (The Etymologies gives helyanwë.)
	ilya adj. and noun "all" (LR:47, 56; SD:310), "all, the whole" (IL); "each, every, all of a particular group of things" (VT39:20); ilyë before a plural noun, "all" being inflected like an adjective (Nam, RGEO:67): ilyë tier "all paths" (Namárië, VT39:20), ilyë mahalmar "all thrones" (CO), ilya raxellor "from all dangers" (VT44:9; we might expect *ilyë raxellor here), ilyárëa (older ilyázëa) "daily, of every day" (evidently ilya "every" + árë, ázë "day" + -a adjectival ending) (VT43:18). Tolkien apparently abandoned ilyárëa in favour of ilaurëa, q.v.
-ima adjectival suffix. Sometimes it is used to derive simple adjectives, like vanima "fair" or calima "bright"; it can also take on the meaning "-able" (PE17:68), as in mátima “edible” (mat- “eat”), nótima “countable” (not- “count”) and (with a negative prefix) úquétima "unspeakable" (from quet- "speak"). Note that the stem-vowel is normally lengthened in the derivatives where -ima means "-able", though this fails to occur in cenima “visible” (q.v., but contrast hraicénima, q.v.) and also before a consonant cluster as in úfantima “not concealable” (PE17:176). "X-ima" may mean "apt to X" (when the ending is added to an intransitive verbal stem), as in Fírimar "mortals", literally "those apt to die" (WJ:387). The adj. úfantima “not concealable” (PE17:176) also appears as úfantuma (PE17:180), indicating the existence of a variant ending -uma (possibly used to derive adjectives with a “bad” meaning; compare the ending *-unqua next to -inqua, q.v.)
	[imba], see imbë #2
	Imbar place-name "the Habitation, = Earth," also "the principal part of Arda" (= the Solar System) (MR:337, also WJ:419 note 29)
	imbë (1) prep "between" (Nam, RGEO:67, VT47:11, PE17:92). This is "between" referring to a gap, space, barrier, or anything intervening between two other things, like or unlike one another (compare enel). The pluralized form imbi implies "among" of several things (ancalima imbi eleni "brightest among stars"); "in the sense 'among' before plurals [imbë] is usually pluralized > imbi even when a plural noun follows". As pointed out by Patrick Wynne, imbi may also be used in the sense of "between" before two singular nouns connected by "and" (as in the example imbi Menel Cemenyë "between heaven and earth"), whereas imbë is used before dual forms, as in the examples imbë siryat "between two rivers", imbë met "between us". Elided imb' in the phrase imb' illi "among all" (VT47:11, 30). A dual form imbit is also mentioned, used to express "in absolute form the sense 'between two things' when these are not named" (apparently meaning that imbit expresses *"between them" referring to two entities, with no noun following) (VT47:30, PE17:92)
	imbë (2) noun "dell, deep vale" (VT45:18), ”wide ravine (between high mountain sides)” (PE17:92)
	imbë (3) adv. "in(wards)" (obsoleted by #1 and #2 above?). Changed by Tolkien from imba (VT45:18)
	imbi, pluralized form of imbë #1, q.v.
	imbit, dualized form of imbë #1, q.v.
	ímen a word occurring in Fíriel's Song, translated "in them" (ar ilqua ímen "and all [that is] in them"). Probably not valid in LotR-style Quenya.
	imi prep. "in"; see mi (VT43:30)
	imíca prep. "among" (VT43:30)
	imlë "yourself, thyself", 2nd person formal sg. reflexive pronoun, e.g. *tirilyë imlë, "you watch yourself". Compare intyë. (VT47:37)
	imma *"itself", impersonal reflexive pronoun referring to the "same thing" (VT47:37) as the subject; compare immo.
	immo, “same one, self” (VT49:33), general singular reflexive pronoun (covering both the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person sg.), except where the subject is impersonal, in which case imma is used instead (VT47:37). Hence *tirin immo "I watch [my]self", *tirilyë immo "you watch [your]self", *tiris immo "(s)he watches [him/her]self" (but apparently *tiris imma "it watches [it]self").
	immë (1) *"ourselves", 1st person pl. reflexive pronoun, probably the exclusive form, e.g. *tirilmë immë "we (excl.) watch ourselves". Compare inwë. (VT47:37)
-immë (2), see -mmë
imnë, also imni, *"myself", 1st person sg. reflexive pronoun, e.g. *tirin imnë/imni "I watch myself" (but apparently the general reflexive pronoun immo can also be used) (VT47:37). In PE17:41, imnë is mentioned as an Old Quenya pronoun meaning “I, I myself” (cf. inyë). 
	?imsë, see insë (it is not entirely clear whether imsë is intended as a Quenya form or as the etymological form underlying insë) (VT47:37)
	imya adj. "same, identical, selfsame" (VT47:37)
	in article, apparently a variant of the definite article i, observed in the phrase i-coimas in-Eldaron "the coimas [lembas] of the Eldar" in PM:403. It looks like the Sindarin plural article, but in Quenya i normally covers both sg. and pl. "the", and the word Eldar does not need any article at all. The alternative reading i-coimas Eldaron (PM:395) is probably to be preferred.
	-ina ending for what Tolkien called "general 'passive' participle" (VT43:15); compare nótina “counted”, rácina “broken”, hastaina “marred” (q.v.). The stem-vowel is usually lengthened when the ending is added to the stem of a primary verb (as in the two first examples above), though the lengthening fails to occur (or is not denoted) in carina as the passive participle of car- “make, do” (VT43:15).
A shorter ending -na also occurs, e.g. nahtana “slain” (VT49:24); the example hastaina “marred” would suggest that *nahtaina is equally possible. In the example aistana "blessed" (VT43:30), -na may be preferred to -ina for euphonic reasons, to avoid creating a second diphthong ai where one already occurs in the previous syllable (*aistaina). In PE17:68, the ending -ina is said to be “aorist” (unmarked as regards time and aspect); the same source states that the shorter ending -na is “no longer part of verbal conjugation”, though it obviously survives in many words that are maybe now to be considered independent adjectives. See -na #4.
	-in dative pl. ending, seen in eldain, fírimoin, q.v.
	inca ("k") noun "idea" (VT45:18, where the word is cited with a final hyphen, though its gloss would indicate that it is a noun not a verb. Originally, the triple glosses "idea, notion, guess" were provided.)
incáno or incánu (“k”), noun “mind master” (PE17:155), cf. cáno. 
incánus (*incánuss-), also incánussë, noun “mind mastership” (PE17:155), associated with Incánus as a name of Gandalf.
	incë (“k”) *“you”, emphatic pronoun for 2nd person pl. familiar, apparently a form abandoned by Tolkien. It is listed as an alternative to ilcë in the source, a query appearing between the forms (VT49:48, 49). The word could also be read as intë (VT49:49)
	indë "yourselves", 2nd person pl.. reflexive pronoun, e.g. *tirildë indë, "you watch yourselves". Indë is derived from earlier imde (VT47:37)
	indemma noun “mind-picture”, i.e. a vision transferred from one mind to another and perceived as visual (and aural) images, usually produced by Elves, though Men were capable of receiving them (especially during sleep) (PE17:174, 179). Compound of indo (#1) + emma. Ephemerally Tolkien may have considered the word fanwos (q.v.) for the same phenomenon.
	indi pl. noun, apparently a name of Men, hardly valid in Tolkien's later Quenya (LT2:343). Compare, however, the final element of Valarindi "Offspring of the Valar", suggesting that #indi can be used for "offspring" (the Quenya word is apparently plural). It may be that in Valarindi, a h has dropped out following r, and that the independent word would be *hindi (as a variant of -hín, -híni “children”).
	indil noun "lily", or other large single flower. Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)
indis noun, translated "wife" in UT:8, but the form is assigned the meaning "bride" in other places (the regular translation of "wife" is rather veri or vessë). Indis "Bride", name of the goddess Nessa. (NDIS-SĒ /SĀ (NETH, NI1, NDER, I) ); Indis Nessa *"Bride Nessa", title and name of the Valië (NETH) The stem-form of indis "bride" is somewhat obscure; according to VT45:37 the stem could be indiss- (pl. indissi given), but the alternative form pl. form inderi shows a curious shift from i to e as well as the more regular change from s (via z) to r between vowels (compare the pl. of olos, q.v.) The stem indiss- may be preferred by writers.
	indo (1) noun “heart, mood” (ID), “state” (perhaps especially state of mind, given the other glosses) (VT39:23), “mind, region/range of thought, mood” (PE17:155, 179), “inner thought, in fea as exhibited in character or [?personality]” (PE17:189). In another post-LotR source, indo is translated “resolve” or “will”, the state of mind leading directly to action (VT41:13). Indo is thus “the mind in its purposing faculty, the will” (VT41:17). Indo-ninya, a word occurring in Fíriel’s Song, translated “my heart” (see ninya). – In the compound indemma “mind-picture”, the first element would seem to be indo.
	indo (2) noun “house” (LT2:343), probably obsoleted by #1 above (in Tolkien’s later Quenya, the word for “house” appears as coa).
	indómë noun "settled character", also used of the "will" of Eru (according to etymological notes written in 1957, referred to in VT43:16, presented in PE17:189). Indómelya "thy will" (VT43:16).
	indor noun "master (of house), lord" (LT2:343; probably obsoleted together with indo "house", q.v.)
	indyalmë noun "clamour" (VT46:3)
	indyo noun "grandchild, descendant" (ÑGYŌ/ÑGYON - read *inyo in Noldorin Quenya, which dialect changed ndy to ny? Cf. Quenya for Quendya.) In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, indyo was also the name of tengwa #17 with overposed dots to indicate following y (VT46:4), the whole symbol having the value ndy.
	-inen pl. instrumental ending. In ómainen (WJ:391)
	inga (1) noun "top, highest point" (PM:340), "only applied to shapes pointing upwards...[it] referred primarily to position and could be used of tops relatively broad". Compounded in the nouns aldinga "tree-top" (alda + inga) (VT47:28), ingaran “high-king” (PM:340)
	inga (2) adj. "first" (ING)
	ingaran noun "high-king" (PM:340), compounded from inga and aran
Ingoldo masc. name; possessive Ingoldova "Ingoldo's" (VT39:16)
	Ingolë noun "Science/Philosophy" as a whole (PM:360; WJ:383 has ingolë ["iñgole"], glossed  "lore". In the Etymologies, stem ÑGOL, the word ingolë was marked as archaic or poetic and is glossed "deep lore, magic").
	ingólemo noun "one with very great knowledge, a 'wizard' ", applied only to great sages of the Eldar in Valinor, like Rúmil (PM:360)
	ingolmo noun "loremaster" (WJ:383)
	Ingolondë place-name "Land of the Gnomes" (Beleriand, "but before applied to parts of Valinor") (ÑGOLOD)
	ingor noun "summit of a mountain" (PM:340); cf. orotinga. 
	Ingwë masc. name, "chief", name of the "prince of Elves" (PM:340, ING, WEG, VT45:18). Pl. Ingwer "Chieftains", what the Vanyar called themselves (so in PM:340, but in PM:332 the plural has the more regular form Ingwi). Ingwë Ingweron "chief of the chieftains", proper title of Ingwë as high king (PM:340). In the Etymologies, Ingwë is also said to be the name of a symbol used in writing: a short carrier with an i-tehta above it, denoting short i (VT45:18).
	inimeitë adj.? ?"female" (INI)
	-inqua adjectival ending, seen in alcarinqua "glorious" (WJ:412) from alcar "glory". Etymologically, -inqua means "-full", like "glory-full" in this case. A variant *-unqua is implied in WJ:415 (only referred to in archaic form -unkwā). “The forms using u were mainly applied to things heavy, clumsy, ugly or bad”, whereas -inqua (in the same source derived from -inkwā) is neutral.
	-inquë pronominal ending (VT49:51, 57), see -ngwë
	insa *"itself", 3rd person sg. impersonal reflexive pronoun, e.g. *tiris insa "it watches itself" (but apparently the general reflexive pronoun immo may also be used, and it may even be preferable since the cluster ns seems unusual for Quenya). Compare insë, the corresponding personal form.
	#insangarë (allative insangarenna attested, VT43:22) noun "temptation", a form Tolkien apparently abandoned in favour of #úsahtië. In Quenya, the cluster ns is unusual.
	insë *"himself" and *"herself", 3rd person sg. personal reflexive pronoun, apparently covering both genders, e.g. *tiris insë "(s)he watches him/herself" (but apparently the general reflexive pronoun immo may also be used, and it may even be preferable since the cluster ns seems unusual for Quenya). Compare insa, the corresponding impersonal form. Insë is derived from earlier imsë, a form that was possibly also used in Quenya (unless "imse" in Tolkien's manuscript is intended as an etymological form only, though it is not asterisked) (VT47:37)
	intë *"themselves", 3rd person pl. reflexive pronoun, e.g. *i neri tirir intë, "the men watch themselves". Intë is derived from earlier imte (VT47:37). Conceivably intë is only used for "themselves" with reference to persons; impersonal "themselves" ought to be *inta or *intai, compare ta #3, tai #2. A form *intai might however have evolved into *intë by the Third Age (like pl. adjectives in -ai later came to end in -ë), thus converging with the “personal” form.% In an earlier source, Tolkien listed intë as an emphatic pronoun *“they”, 3rd person plural (VT49:48, 49); compare the pronominal ending -ntë. The word intë (derived from inde via inze, an unusual development in Quenya) also appears as a candidate 2nd person singular polite form (VT49:49).
	intya- vb. "guess, suppose" (INK/INIK, VT49:33)
	intyë *"yourself, thyself", 2nd person intimate sg. reflexive pronoun, e.g. *tiritye intyë, "you watch yourself" (but apparently the general reflexive pronoun immo can also be used). Compare imlë. (VT47:37)
	intyalë noun "imagination" (INK/INIK, VT49:33)
	inwë *"ourselves", 1st person pl. reflexive pronoun, evidently the inclusive form, e.g. *tirilvë inwë "we (incl.) watch ourselves". Compare immë. (VT47:37)
	inwis noun “change of mind, mood”. A following, bracketed form inwissi is either the plural, the ancestral form or a variant (PE17:191; cf. inwisti). Likely, inwis is to have the stem inwiss- before endings (alternatively inwist-, see inwisti below, and compare the verb vista- “to change”). 
	inwisti noun "mind-mood" (changed by Tolkien from inwaldi) (MR:216, 471). The word may seem to be plural in form, despite its singular gloss. Cf. variant inwis above (which could be the singular, if it has the stem inwist-).
	inya (1) adj. "female" (INI)
inya (2) adj. "small" (LT1:256; this "Qenya" word may be obsoleted by # 1 above)
inyë emphatic independent 1st person sg. pronoun, "I" with emphasis, translated "I, too" in LR:61 (and, according to one reading of Tolkien’s manuscript, in VT49:49).
[Iolossë] place-name "Everlasting Snow" = Taniquetil (GEY, EY; changed to Oiolossë)
	ion pl. relative pron. in genitive "from whom, *of whom", pl. (VT47:21). See i #2 (relative pronoun).
	-ion (patronymic ending) "son (of), descendant" (YŌ/YON, LT1:271, LT2:344). Not to be confused with the genitive ending -on when added to words with nominative plurals in -i, e.g. elenion "of stars" vs. eleni "stars".
	Ipsin noun “fine thread” (PE17:17)
	[íra adj. "eternal" (GEY, VT45:13; changed by Tolkien to oira, see OY)] 
	írë (1) noun "desire". (ID). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, írë was also the name of a long carrier with an i-tehta above it, denoting long í. (VT45:17).
írë (2) conj. "when" (subordinate conjunction, not question-word: írë Anarinya queluva, "when my sun faileth") (FS). Compare yá #2.
[írë] (3) noun "eternal" (read "eternity", as suggested by Christopher Tolkien, but the word was in any case changed to oirë) (GEY, VT45:13)
irícië ("k") see #ric-
	Irildë fem. name "Idhril" (Idril) (LT2:343), #Írildë (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator p. 193), Írildë also as name of a Númenorean woman (UT:210). Irildë Taltyelemna = (later) Sindarin Idril Celebrindal; replaced Irildë Taltelepsa (KYELEP/TELEP; Taltelemna in the Etymologies as printed in LR is an error for Taltyelemna, VT45:25). Tolkien seems to have replaced Irildë as the Quenya form of Idril with Itaril, Itarillë, Itarildë, q.v., in which case the Sindarin form is definitely Idril and not Idhril.
	írima adj. "lovely, beautiful, desirable" (ID, FS, PE17:155), in FS also pl. írimar; in the "Qenya" of Fíriel's Song, adjectives in -a form their plurals in -ar instead of -ë as in LotR-style Quenya.
	irin noun "town" (LT2:343; hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Írissë fem. name (PM:345), evidently connected to írë "desire".
	irmin noun "the world, all the regions inhabited by Men" (LT2:343; hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Irmo masc. name "Desirer", name of a Vala; normally called Lórien, properly the place where he dwells (WJ:402)
	is noun "light snow" (LT1:256)
	-is ending for the plural form of an unidentified case, by some called "respective" or "short locative" (Plotz)
	isca ("k") adj. "pale" (LT1:256)
	Isil (þ) place-name "Moon" (FS; SA:sil, Appendix E, SD:302, SIL; also defined as "the Sheen" under THIL); Isildur masc. name., *"Moon-servant" (SA:sil, Appendix A, NDŪ)
isilmë (þ) noun "moonlight", occurring in Markirya; free translation "the moon" in MC:215 (isilmë ilcalassë, literally "moonlight gleaming-in" = "in the moon gleaming"). Isilmë also appears as the name of a Númenorean woman (UT:210).
Isilya (þ) noun, third day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Moon (Appendix D)
isima (þ?) noun “imagination” (if a variant of síma, q.v.; the form isima as such is not clearly glossed) (VT49:16)
isintë pa.t. vb. "knew", irregular pa.t. of ista- (besides sintë) (VT48:25; in VT48:32 this is analyzed as being the same formation as oantë)
	isqua ("q") adj. "wise" (LT2:339).
	issë noun "knowledge, lore" (LT2:339; rather ista or istya in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	-issë a feminine ending, as in Írissë (PM:345)
	ista (1) noun "knowledge" (IS). Also istya.
	ista- (2) vb. "know", pa.t. sintë (IS, LT2:339, VT48:25). This past tense Tolkien called "certainly irregular" (VT48:25, where an alternative pa.t. isintë is also mentioned, but sintë is said to be the older form; compare editorial notes in VT48:32. Ista- is also used for "can" in the sense of "know how to", as in istan quetë "I can speak (because I have learned (a) language)" (VT41:6) Passive participle sinwa “known, certain, ascertained” (VT49:68)
	Istar noun "Wizard", used of Gandalf, Saruman, Radagast etc.  Pl. Istari is attested. Gen. pl. in the phrase Heren Istarion "Order of Wizards" (UT:388). “The istari are translated ‘wizards’ because of the connexion of ‘wizard’ with wise and so with ‘witting’ and knowing” (Letters:207); by this translation Tolkien tries to reproduce the relationship between Quenya istar and ista- #1, 2. 
	istima adj. "having knowledge" (IS)
	Istimor pl. noun *"Wise Ones" = "Gnomes" (Noldor) (IS). Sg. #Istimo.
	istya noun "knowledge" (IS). Also ista (#1).
	istyar noun "scholar, learned man" (IS). According to VT45:18, Tolkien at one point also meant istyar to be the name of Tengwa #13 with overposed dots to indicate a palatal sound; the letter would thus have the value sty. However, according to the classical Tengwar spelling of Quenya as outlined in LotR Appendix E, such a letter would rather have the value *nty (since #13 is there assigned the value nt in Quenya).
	iswa adj. "wise" (LT2:339); rather saila in Tolkien’s later Quenya.
	-itë adjectival ending, often attached to nouns with the sense of “having X” or “having the quality of X” (VT49:42)
	íta noun "a flash" (PM:363)
	ita- 1) vb. "sparkle" (SA:ril, PM:363)
ita, íta adv. 2) “very, extremely” (PE17:112). Like #1 above, this element emerged as part of Tolkien’s efforts to explain the initial element of the name Idril (Q Itaril), so it is questionable if #1 and #2 were ever meant to coexist in the “same” version of Quenya.
	ita 3) pron “that which” (VT49:12), emended from tai (#1, q.v.) The form ita is compounded from the relative pronoun i + the pronoun ta “that, it”.
	Itaril (*Itarill-), Itarillë, Itarildë fem. name, Sindarized as Idril (PM:346, 348; SA:ril). (In earlier sources, Tolkien used Irildë as the Quenya form of Idril, and the proper Noldorin/Sindarin form was then Idhril.) 
	itila adj. (or participle?) "twinkling, glinting" (PM:363)
	-iva (-ivë) plural possessive ending; seen in Eldaiva, Eldaivë (WJ:369)
	Íverind-, Íverindor place-name "Ireland" (LT2:344) The nominative of Íverind- must be *Íverin, the form Íverind- occurring before endings. Compare Íwerin below.
	Íwerin place-name "Ireland" (also Íverindor, Íverind-, which forms are probably to be preferred in a LotR-compatible form of Quenya) (LT2:344)
	†ixal noun “a cast shadow” (PE17:184)


<K> (see C-)
	kakainen, see caita-
	kelvar (sg. #kelva) noun "animals, living things that move" (Silm)
	kemen noun "earth"; see cemen.
	Kementári noun "Earth-queen", title of Yavanna (SA:tar). The Kemen- of this name was at one stage intended as the genitive of kén, kem- "earth", so that Kementári meant "Earth's Queen", but Tolkien later changed the Quenya genitive ending from -(e)n to -o. Apparently so as to maintain the name Kementári, he turned kemen into the nominative form; see cemen.
kwí, kwíta, particle indicating uncertainty (evidently like English "maybe, perhaps"). We would expect the spelling quí, quíta (VT42:34). See cé (which form is perhaps to be preferred)
	kyermë noun *"prayer", isolated from Erukyermë (UT:166)

<L>
	-l or -lyë (VT49:48, 51), pronominal endings for 2nd person sg. polite/formal “you, thou”: caril or carilyë *“you do” (VT49:16), hamil “you judge” (VT42:33), anel “you were” (see ná #1); see -lyë for further examples. These endings may also be added to pronouns (etel/etelyë or mil, milyë; see et, mi). In one source, -l is rather used as a reduced affix denoting plural “you”; see heca! (WJ:364) 
	la negation "no, not" (see lá); also prefix la- as in lacarë, q.v. (VT45:25)
	lá (1) adv. “no, not" (LA, VT45:25) According to VT42:33, lá is the stressed form, alternating with la when the negation is unstressed. – In another conceptual phase of Tolkien's, lá had the opposite meaning "yes" (VT42:32-33), but this idea is contradicted by both earlier and later material: usually lá is conceived as a negation. – The negation can receive tense markers and be used as a negative verb “when [another] verb is not expressed” (VT49:13), apparently where the phrase “is not” is followed by a noun or an adjective as a predicate, or where some verb is understood, as in English “I do not” (i.e. “I do not do whatever the context indicates”). With pronominal endings la- in the aorist, e.g. lanyë “I do not, am not” (etc.) (Tolkien abandoned the form lamin.) Exemplified in the sentence melin sé apa lanyë hé *“I love him but I do not [love] him” (another person) (VT49:15). Present tense laia, past lánë, perfect alaië, future lauva.
	lá (2) prep. “athwart, over, across, beyond” (PE17:65), also used in phrases of comparison, e.g. "A ná calima lá B", A is bright beyond (= brighter than) B (VT42:32).  
	[lá (3) interjection? "please" (reading of gloss uncertain) (VT45:25)]
lacarë ("k") noun "not-doing, inaction" (in general) (VT42:33)
	lá umë > laumë negation "no indeed not, on the contrary" ("also used for asking incredulous questions"). This is a combination of the negation lá "not" and the negative verb umë "is not, does not" (LA)
	lahta- vb. “pass over, cross, surpass, excel” (PE17:92)
	[lai adverbial particle "very" (VT45:8)]
	laia, see lá #1
	laica (1) adj. "green" (in older sources laiqua) (Letters:282, PE17:159). Laicolassë (laica + #olassë) “green-foliage” (PE17:46), Quenya cognate of Sindarin Laegolas (dialectal form Legolas); compare olassië. Adj. laicalassë “green as leaves”, literally “green-leaf” (PE17:56).
	laica (2) ("k") adj. "keen, sharp, acute, piercing" (LAIK, LT2:337 – in the Etymologies as printed in LR, the final vowel is misread as -e instead of -a, VT45:25). Possibly obsoleted by #1 above. Compare aica #1.
	laicë noun “keenness of perception” (LAIK). Cf. laica #2. 
	laicolassë, see laica #1
	laima noun “plant” (PE17:159). Cf. olvar.
	laimë noun "shade" (DAY; in an earlier version the gloss was "shadow (cast by an object or form)"; see VT45:8-9. Perhaps Tolkien transferred this meaning to lëo when giving laimë the more general meaning "shade".)
	laiqua ("q") adj. "green" (LÁYAK, LT1:267, MC:214), "Qenya" pl. laiquali ("q") (MC:216). Occurs in the phrase laiqua'ondoisen ("q") "green-rocks-upon" (MC:221; this is "Qenya"), Laiqualassë ("q") masc. name "Legolas" (Greenleaf) (LT1:267). Used as noun in the phrase mi laiqua of somebody clad “in green” (PE17:71). In later material, the word for "green" appears as laica, and the cognate of Legolas is said to be Laicolassë, q.v. (PE17:56)
	laiquaninwa ("q") adj. *"green-blue"? (cf. ninwa) (Narqelion)
	laiquassë ("q") noun "greenness" (LT1:267)
	laiquë noun “herb” (“anything green, but especially as used for food”) (PE17:159)
	Laiquendi noun "Green-elves", not much used (translated from Sindarin Laegil, Laegelrim) (WJ:385, SA:quen-/quet-, LÁYAK; spelt "Laiqendi" in the latter source)
	laira adj. "shady" (DAY)
	lairë (1) noun "summer" (Letters:283, VT45:26), in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 72 days, but also used without any exact definition (Appendix D). Oiolairë "Eversummer", name of a tree (UT:167), see also Coron Oiolairë. Lairelossë noun *"Summer-snow", name of a tree (UT:167), perhaps with white flowers.
	lairë (2) noun "poem" (GLIR)
lairë (3) noun "meadow" (LT1:267, GL:39 – perhaps a doubtful word in LotR-style Quenya, since lairë already has to carry two other meanings)
lairus (lairust-) noun "verdigris" (VT41:10)
laisi, laito noun "youth, vigour, new life" (LT1:267; rather vië or nésë, nessë in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	laita- vb. "bless, praise": a laita, laita te! Andavë laituvalmet! ... Cormacolindor, a laita tárienna "bless them, bless them! Long shall we bless them! ... [The] Ring-bearers, praise [them] to [the] height!" (lait[a]-uva-lme-t  "bless-shall-we-them) (LotR3:VI ch. 4, translated in Letters:308; the meaning of the suffix -lmë was revised from inclusive to exclusive “we”, VT49:55). Verbal noun laitalë "praising", isolated from Erulaitalë (UT:166, 436)
	laivë noun "ointment" (LIB2)
	laiwa adj. "sick, sickly, ill" (SLIW, VT45:28). Since Tolkien eventually decided that roots in sl- yield Quenya words in hl- (though this was pronounced l- in late Exilic Quenya), it may be that the spelling *hlaiwa is to be preferred.
	lala- (1) vb. "laugh" (PM:359), possibly with pa.t. *landë because the stem is given as g-lada-.
	lala- (2) vb. "to deny" (LA)
	lala (3) negation "no indeed not, on the contrary" ("also used for asking incredulous questions") (LA)
	lalantila ??? (Narqelion)
	lalmë noun "elm-tree" (ÁLAM). Cf. alvë in a post-LotR source.
	Lalwendë (also short Lalwen) noun "Laughing Maiden", fem. name (PM:343)
	láma noun "ringing sound, echo" (LAM)
	laman (lamn- or simply laman-, as in pl. lamni or lamani) noun "animal" (usually applied to four-footed beasts, and never to reptiles and birds; a more general word may be #celva) (WJ:416)
	lamárë noun “flock” (QL:50)
	lámatyávë (pl. lámatyáver attested) noun "sound-taste" (láma + tyávë), individual pleasure in the sounds and forms of words (MR:215, 471)
	lamba (1) noun "tongue" (physical tongue, while lambë = "language") (WJ:394, LAB; according to VT45:25, Tolkien first wrote lambe, but as noted, this alternative form is rather used for "tongue" in the sense of "language")
	lamba (2) noun ?"hammer" (possibly an alternative form of namba, q.v., but the source is obscure and namba is to be preferred) (VT45:37)
	lambë noun "tongue, language" (the usual word for 'language' in non-technical use) (WJ:368, 394, ÑGAL/ÑGALAM), "the language or dialect of a particular country or people...never used for 'language' in general, but only for particular forms of speech" (VT39:15); also name of tengwa #27 (Appendix E). (In early "Qenya", lambë was defined as "tongue" of body, but also of land, or even = "speech" [LT2:339]. In LotR-style Quenya lambë only means "tongue = speech", whereas the word for a physical tongue is lamba.) Lambë Valarinwa "Valarin tongue" (WJ:397), lambë Quendion "the language of the Elves" (PM:395), Lambengolmor pl. noun "Loremasters of Tongues", a school founded by Fëanor (WJ:396); sg. #Lambengolmo. Spelt Lambeñgolmor in VT48:6. 
lambelë noun "Language" (especially with reference to phonology), *"phonetics" (VT39:15)
#lambetengwë noun "consonant" (as a tengwë or phoneme), literally "tongue-signs". Only pl. lambetengwi ("ñ") is attested (VT39:16)
lambina adj. “of tongue, spoken with tongue” (PE17:46). Cf. lambë.
	lámina adj. "echoing" (LAM)
	lamma noun "sound" (LAM)
	lamya- vb. "to sound" (LAM, VT45:25)
	lanat noun "weft" (LAN)
	lanca ("k") noun "sharp edge (not of tools); sudden end" ("as e.g. a cliff-edge, or the clean edge of things made by hand or built, also used in transferred senses, as in kuivie-lankasse, literally 'on the brink of life', of a perilous situation in which one is likely to fall into death" – VT42:8)
	lanco ("k") noun "throat, swallow" (LAK1 , LANK). Since this was changed by Tolkien from lango with stem *langu- and pl. langwi, it may be that lanco should similarly have the stem *lancu- and pl. *lanqui.
landa (1) noun  "boundary" (VT42:8)
	landa (2) adj. "wide" (LAD). Maybe in landatavárë = *"wide-wood"? (TI:415)
lanë (lani-) noun  "hem" (VT42:8)

	lango (1) noun "broad sword", also "prow of a ship" (LAG)
	lango (2) noun “passage”, especially across or over an obstacle, also “neck” (PE17:92)
	[lango (3) noun "throat"] (Tolkien also listed the plural form langwi; in the Etymologies as printed in LR, Christopher Tolkien improperly prefixed an asterisk as if it were an primitive or wrong form; see VT45:26. This indicates that lango has the stem-form *langu-. Compare ango "snake", stem #angu-, pl. angwi. But whatever the case, lango was changed to lanco.) (LANG, see LANK)
	langon noun "throat" (MC:216; this is "Qenya", possibly an inflected form of lango #2 above – but Tolkien changed it to lanco)
	langwi - see lango
	lanna prep. “athwart” (PE17:65)
	lannë noun "tissue, cloth" (LAN)
	lanta (1) noun "a fall" (DAT/DANT (TALÁT) ), also lantë.
 	lanta- (2) "fall" (DAT/DANT (TALÁT), Narqelion, VT45:26, VT49:54); lantar aorist tense pl. (Nam, RGEO:66); pl. pa.t. lantaner "fell" (pl.) (SD:246); lantier "they fell", a plural past tense of lanta- "fall" occurring in LR:47; read probably lantaner in LotR-style Quenya, as in SD:246. Also sg. lantië "fell" (LR:56); read likewise *lantanë? (The forms in -ier, -ië seem to be properly perfects.) Future tense lantuva, VT49:47. Participle lantala "falling" (with locative ending: lantalassë) in Markirya.
	lantalasselingëa adj. “with a musical sound of falling leaves” (PE16:96)
lantalca ("k") noun "boundary post or mark" (VT42:8, 28)
lanta-mindon Qenya pl. noun "fallen-towers"; inflected compound lanta-ránar "in falling-moon" (with pre-classical locative -r) (MC:214; these forms are "Qenya") 
	#lantë (1) noun  "fall" in Noldolantë, q.v. Also lanta.
	lantë (2) adj.? participle? "falling" (MC:214; this is "Qenya" - in Tolkien's later Quenya lantala)
	lanu noun "lead" (LT1:268)
lanwa (1) adj. "within bounds, limited, finite, (well-)defined" (VT42:8)
	lanwa (2) noun  "loom" (LAN)
	lanwë (stem *lanwi-, given primitive form ¤danmi) noun "ebb-tide" (VT48:32). Compare nanwë.
lanya- (1) vb. "bound, enclose, separate from, mark the limit of" (VT42:8)
	lanya- (2) vb. "weave" (LAN)
	#lanya (3) noun “thread”, isolated from hísilanya “mist thread” (PE17:60)
	lanyë, see lá #1
lapattë noun "hare" (GL:52)
lappa noun "hem of robe" (GL:52)
	lapsa- vb. "to lick" (frequentative) (LAB)
	lapsë noun "babe" (LAP)
	[laque[t]-] ("q") vb. ?"deny" (VT45:25)
	lár (1) noun "league", a linear measure, 5000 rangar (q.v.). A ranga was approximately 38 inches, so a lár was "5277 yards, two feet and four inches [ca. 4826 m], supposing the equivalence to be exact" - close enough to our league of 5280 yards to justify this translation. The basic meaning of lár is "pause";  in marches a brief halt was made for each league. (UT:285)
	lár (2) noun "ear" (?). Tolkien's wording is not clear, but ¤lasū is given as an ancient dual form "(pair of) ears"; Quenya lár could represent the old singular las- (LAS2). In a post-LotR source, Tolkien derives hlas “ear” (dual hlaru) from a stem SLAS (PE17:62). Initial hl- rather than l- reflects the revised form of the stem (LAS becoming SLAS), and in the later version of the phonology, postvocalic -s does not become -r when final. Compare the noun “dream”, given as olor in the Etymologies (LOS), but as olos pl. olori in a later source (UT:396)
	lar (1) noun "fat, riches" (VT45:26; Hostetter and Wynne suggest that the second gloss should perhaps read "richness" rather than "riches")
	[lar (2) noun "(good) fortune, prosperity, Bliss" (VT45:26; the Qenya genitive form láren is also listed)]
	lára (1) adj. "flat" (DAL, VT45:25)
	[lára (2) noun "grave" (VT45:8)]
	[lára (3) adj. "blessed", also lárëa (VT45:26)]
	[lárë vb. "happen" (VT45:26; the word has an unusual shape for a verb, and was in any case deleted)]
	lárëa (1) adj. "fat, rich" (VT45:26)
	[lárëa (2), see lára #3]
	larca ("k") adj. "swift, rapid" (LAK2)
	#larma (1) noun “raiment”, attested in pl. form larmar (PE17:175)
	larma (2) noun "[?pig-]fat, flesh" (VT45:25; the initial element of the gloss "pig-fat" is not certainly legible in Tolkien's manuscript)
	[larma (3) noun "lucky event"; additional glosses in Tolkien's manuscript are tentatively read as "pleasure, mirth" by Hostetter and Wynne (VT45:26)]
	lasi or lasir, -sír adv. “on the contrary”, possibly an ephemeral form Tolkien replaced by úsië (VT49:17-18)
	lassë noun "leaf"; pl. lassi is attested (Nam, RGEO:66, Letters:283, LAS1, LT1:254, VT39:9, Narqelion); gen. lassëo "of a leaf", gen. pl. lassion "of leaves" (earlier lassio) (WJ:407). The word lassë was only applied to certain kinds of leaves, especially those of trees (PE17:62), perhaps particularly ear-shaped leaves (cf. the entry LAS1 in the Etymologies, where Tolkien comments on the pointed or leaf-shaped Elvish ears and suggests an etymological connection between words for “ear” and “leaf”); see also linquë #3. Compound lasselanta "leaf-fall", used (as was quellë) for the latter part of autumn and the beginning of winter (Appendix D, Letters:428); hence Lasselanta alternative name of October (PM:135). Cf. also lassemista "leaf-grey, grey-leaved" (LotR2:III ch. 4, translated in Letters:224, PE17:62), lassewinta a variant of lasselanta (PM:376). Adj. laicalassë “green as leaves” (PE17:56). See also lillassëa, lantalasselingëa.
lassecanta ("k") adj. "leaf-shaped" (KAT)
	lasselanta noun "leaf-fall = Autumn" (DAT/DANT, LAS1, Narqelion, LT1:254; "lasse-lanta" in VT45:24,  but again lasselanta in VT45:26)
	lasta- vb. "listen", also lasta adj. "listening, hearing" (LAS2, PE17:56); cf. adj. asalastë (*aþa-) adj. “easily heard” (PE17:148)
	Lastalaica ("k") noun "sharp-ears" (name) (LAS2). Compare laica #2.
	láta adj. "open" (VT39:23), "open, not closed" (PE17:159, VT41:5)
látië noun "openness" (VT39:23)
latin, latina adj. "open, free, cleared (of land)" (LAT). According to VT41:5, the adjective latina "is used rather of freedom of movement, of things not encumbered with obstacles".
	latta (1) noun "hole, pit" (DAT/DANT, VT45:8)
	latta (2) noun "strap" (LATH)
	latucenda ("k") adj. "of tin" (LT1:268)
	latya (1) noun "opening" (used as abstract in the source) (VT39:23). See sanwë-latya.
latya- (2) vb. "to open anything (so as to allow entry)” (PE17:159). Cf. the negated form avalatya *"un-open" = to "close"? (VT41:6). See ava- #3.
lau negation "no indeed not, on the contrary" ("also used for asking incredulous questions") (LA)
	lauca ("k") adj. "warm" (LAW)
	laulesta noun “livelihood” (QL:53)
	laumë < lá umë negation "no indeed not, on the contrary" ("also used for asking incredulous questions") This is a combination of the negation lá "not" and the negative verb umë "is not, does not" (LA)
	laupë noun "shirt, tunic" (QL:51)
	†laurë noun "gold", but of golden light and colour, not of the metal: “golden light” (according to PE17:61 a poetic word). Nai laurë lantuva parmastanna lúmissen tengwiesto “may (a) golden light fall on your book at the times of your reading” (VT49:47). In Etym defined as "light of the golden Tree Laurelin, gold", not properly used of the metal gold (LÁWAR/GLÁWAR, GLAW(-R), VT27:20, 27, PE17:159). In early "Qenya", however, laurë was defined as "(the mystic name of) gold" (LT1:255, 258) or simply "gold" (LT1:248, 268). In Laurelin and Laurefindil, q.v., Laurenandë "Gold-valley" = Lórien (the land, not the Vala) (UT:253) and laurinquë name of a tree, possibly *"Gold-full one" (UT:168). Laurendon “like gold” or “in gold fashion” (but after citing this form, Tolkien decided to abandon the similative ending -ndon, PE17:58).
laurëa adj. "golden, like gold"; pl. laurië is attested (Nam, RGEO:66)
Laurefindil masc. name, Quenya form of Glorfindel (PE17:17)
	Laurelin ("g.sg. Laurelinden" or Laurelingen; in LotR-style Quenya this is dat.sg.) Name of the Golden Tree of Valinor, interpreted both *"singing-gold" (stem Laurelind-) and "hanging-gold" (stem Laureling-) (LIN2, VT45:27, LÁWAR/GLÁWAR, [GLAW(-R)], SA, Letters:308)
Laurelindórinan noun "Valley of Singing Gold", an earlier name of Laurenandë (Lórien) (UT:253); laurelindórenan lindelorendor malinornélion ornemalin *"Goldenlight-music-land-valley music-dream-land of yellow-trees tree-yellow", Quenya elements agglutinated in Entish fashion; this supposedly means something like "the valley where the trees in a golden light sing musically, a land of music and dreams; there are yellow trees there, it is a tree-yellow land" (LotR2:III ch. 4, translated in Letters:308). The last word ornemalin is defined in as “bearing yellow flowers” in PE17:80.
laurië noun “goldenness”, also used as adv. “goldenly” (PE17:74); the word laurië occurring in Namarië Tolkien variously interpreted either as this adverb or as the pl. form of laurëa, q.v.
	laurina adj. "golden" (LT1:258). Compare laurëa in later material.
	Laurundo masc. name "Glorund" (> Glaurung). Also Undolaurë. (LT2:341)
	laustanë adj.? participle?  "roaring" (MC:213; this is "Qenya") 
	laustaner vb. in past tense 'lausted' ("not 'roared' or 'rushed' but made a windy noise" – but in MC:220, Tolkien himself translated laustanéro as "rushed") (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	lauva, see lá #1
	#lav- (1) vb. "lick", pa.t. #lávë in undulávë, see undu (Nam); 1st person aorist lavin "I lick" in the Etymologies (LAB)
	lav- (2) vb. "yield, allow, grant" (DAB)
	lávar noun “(golden) blossom”. Also loa. (PE17:159)
	lavaralda (changed by Tolkien from lavarin) noun some kind of tree (alda) (LR:57). The initial element lavar- seems to connect with the root LAWAR having to do with golden colour; cf. lávar “(golden) blossom” (PE17:159).
	[-lca (“k”) ?“your”, apparently an abandoned 2nd person plural possessive (VT49:49). Cf. -cca.]
	-lda (1) "your", 2nd person pl. possessive suffix (VT49:16). Onnalda *“your child” (VT49:42). In an earlier manuscript, this ending was used for singular “you” instead, attested in the phrase Arwen vanimalda "Arwen your beauty", sc. "O beautiful Arwen", and in meletyalda "your majesty" (WJ:369) Arwen vanimalda was however changed to Arwen vanimelda in the second edition of LotR, Tolkien reinterpreting the last word (see vanimalda). The ending for singular "your" appears as -lya elsewhere. (LotR1:II ch. 6)
	[-lda] (2) in some versions of Quenya a comparative or augmentative suffix, later abandoned by Tolkien (PE17:55, 56). See vanimalda. 
	-ldë (1) pronominal suffix “you”, 2nd person pl. (VT49:51; carildë *“you do”, VT49:16). This ending Tolkien revised from -llë in earlier sources (VT49:48, cf. PE17:69).
	-ldë (2) feminine agental suffix. Tolkien at one point commented that Varda’s title Tintallë “Kindler” should be Tintaldë because the ending -llë was rather the suffix for plural “you” (PE17:69). Since this pronominal suffix -llë was later revised to -ldë, it is now the ending of Tintaldë itself that would be potentially problematic.
	le, pronominal element "you", (originally) the "reverential 2nd person sing" (RGEO:73, VT49:56). However, singular le was apparently altered to lye (q.v.), and le took on a plural significance (le for pl. “you” is apparently derived from de, the ancient 2nd person pl. stem, VT49:50-51). Stressed lé (VT49:51), dual let *“the two of you” (ibid.). At certain points in Tolkien’s conception, le was still sg. “thou” rather than pl. “you”. It is attested as an ending in the imperative form antalë *"give thou" (VT43:17); see anta-. The form ólë in VT43:29 apparently means *"with thee"; according to Tolkien’s later system, it would rather mean “with you” (pl.) Compare aselyë “with thee” (sg.) in a later source (see as).
	lé (1) noun “way” = “method, manner” (“as in that is not A’s way”). Not to be confused with lé as a stressed form of le = plural “you”; Tolkien was himself dissatisfied with this clash (PE17:74).
	lé (2) prep. “with” (PE17:95)
	-lë ending forming nouns that "seem properly to have been universal and abstract" (VT39:16, in which source Tolkien is actually commenting on the prehistoric form -lē, but -lë is its Quenya descendant)
	lehta- (1) vb. "loose, slacken" (LEK)
lehta (2) adj. "free, released" (VT39:17); #lehta tengwë "free element, released element", a term for "vowel" (only pl. lehta tengwi [ñ] is attested; we would rather expect *lehtë tengwi with the pl. form of the adjective) (VT39:17)
lélinë, pa.t. of lelya- #3
	#lelta- vb. "send", attested in the past tense with pronominal suffixes: leltanelyes "you sent him" (VT47:21)
	lelya- (1) vb. "go, proceed (in any direction), travel", pa.t. lendë / elendë (WJ:363, VT14:5, PE17:139)  At one point Tolkien assigned a more specific meaning to the underlying root LED: “go away – from the speaker or the point in mind, depart” (PE17:52), which would make lelya- a near synonym of auta-. The same source denies that the derivatives of LED were used simply for “go, move, travel”, but elsewhere Tolkien assigns precisely that meaning to lelya-. 
	lelya (2) adj. “delicate, beautiful & fine, slender; lovely” (PE17:139, 151)
	lelya- (3) vb. “appear, of beautiful things, hence attract, enchant (with dative)”, pa.t. lélinë (PE17:151)
	lemba adj. "left behind" (LEB/LEM)
	Lembi noun "Elves remaining behind" = Telerin Ilkorins (LEB/LEM, PE17:143). Sg. #Lembë. Also called Úamanyar.
	lemen, alternative cardinal "five" (VT48:6, 20); the word normally appears as lempë, but compare lemenya below.
lemenya archaic ordinal adj. "fifth", replaced by lempëa (VT42:25)
	lemnar noun "week" (of five days) (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK). Compare enquië, otsola.
lempë cardinal "five" (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK, GL:53, VT42:24, VT47:10, 24); lempëa ordinal "fifth", an analogical formation replacing older lemenya, in turn altered from the historically "correct" form lepenya because of analogy with the cardinal lempë "five" (VT42:25; Vanyarin Quenya maintained lepenya, VT42:26)
lemya- vb. "remain, tarry" (VT45:27)
	lenca ("k") (1) adj. "slow" (LT2:341, cf. VT49:11)
	lenca- ("k") (2) vb.  "loose, slacken" (LEK. In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the misreading leuka [for lenka] appears; cf. VT45:27) 
	lenda (1) noun “journey” (PE17:60)
	lenda- (2) vb. "linger" (VT45:27)
	lendë vb. "left, went" (pa.t. of lelya- "go") (FS, LR:47, SD:310, WJ:362), or, according to the Etymologies, the pa.t. of lenna- "go" and lesta- "leave" (LED, ELED. In the Etymologies as printed in LR, lenna- was misread as "linna-"; see VT45:27)
	lenémë prep. "with leave" (+ genitive: "with leave of") (SD:246)
	lenga- vb. “behave” (called a “weak verb”) (PE17:74)
	lengë noun “gesture, characteristic look, gesture or trait etc.” (PE17:74)
	lenna- vb. "go", pa.t. lendë "went" (LED; cf. lelya-). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the word lenna- wrongly appears as **linna-; see VT45:27.
	lenu- vb. "stretch" (LT2:341)
	[#lenta- vb. "send", attested in the past tense with pronominal suffixes: lentanelyes "you sent him". Changed by Tolkien to #lelta-, q.v. (VT47:22, 21)]
	lenwa adj. "long and thin, straight, narrow" (LT2:341)
	lenwë (1) noun “leaving, departure” (PE17:51)
	Lenwë (2) noun the leader of the Nandor (Nandorin Denweg, primitive ¤Denwego) (WJ:412)

	lëo noun "shade, shadow cast by any object" (DAY)
	lepecan ("k") noun "fourth finger" (counted from the thumb) (VT47:10, VT48:5), also lepentë
	[lependë] noun "middle finger", also lepenel (VT47:10, VT48:15; struck out)
	lepenel noun "middle finger", also [lependë] (VT47:10, VT48:5; lependë was struck out, VT48:15)
	lepentë noun "fourth finger" (counted from the thumb) (VT48:5, 14, 15), also lepecan
	leper (pl. leperi given) noun "finger" (VT44:16, VT47:10, 14, 24, VT48:5; an older source gives the word for "finger" as lepsë, q.v.)
	lepetas noun "first or index finger" (VT47:10, VT48:5, 14). Stem lepetass- (pl. lepetassi, VT47:11) Also tassa.
	lepinca ("k") noun "little finger" (VT47:10); variant lepincë (VT47:26, VT48:5)
	lepincë ("k") noun "little finger" (VT47:26, VT48:5); variant lepinca (VT47:10). According to VT48:15, 18, lepincë is derived from older lepinki; if so the Quenya form should have the stem lepinci-.
	lepsat fraction "one fifth" (1/5), also lepesta (VT48:11)
lepsë noun "finger" (LEP/LEPET; see leper). According to VT45:27, Tolkien derived lepsë from primitive ¤lepti; if so, lepsë should have the stem-form *lepsi-. However, Tolkien struck out the ancestral form lepti, so we cannot be sure whether this idea was maintained or not. In later sources, the word for "finger" appears as leper.
lepta- vb. "pick (up, out) with the fingers" (VT44:16, VT47:10), "[to] finger, feel with fingertips" (VT47:25)
	leptafinya (also just finya) adj. “clever(-fingered)” (PE17:17)
	leptenta- vb. *”point to/indicate with the finger“ (gloss suggested by Patrick Wynne) (VT49:24). Cf. tenta-, hententa-. 
**lér noun "man" (NI1; hypothetical Q form of PQ dēr; the form actually used in Quenya was nér)
léra adj. noun "free", of persons (VT41:5)
lerembas noun “lembas” (waybread of the Elves) (PE17:52); in a later source, the Quenya word for lembas is however given as coimas, q.v.
lerina adj. "free" of things: not guarded, reserved, made fast, or "owned" (VT41:5)
lerya- vb. "release, set free, let go"; negated avalerya- "bind, make fast, restrain, deprive of liberty" (VT41:5, 6)
lerta- vb.  "can" in the sense "be free to do", being under no restraint (physical or other). Lertan quetë "I can speak (because I am free to do so, there being no obstacle of promise, secrecy, or duty)". Where the absence of a physical restraint is considered, this verb can be used in much the same sense as pol- (VT41:6)
lesta- (1) vb. "leave", pa.t. lendë (which is also the pa.t. of lelya-, q.v.) (ELED)
#lesta (2) noun “measure”, only attested in the instrumental case: lestanen "in measure" (FS). The name Lestanórë (q.v.) may contain a distinct noun #lesta “fence” or “girdle”.
	Lestanórë place-name "Doriath", gen. Lestanórëo (WJ:369). If this name means the same as the Sindarin name Doriath, “Land of the Fence”, #lesta ought to mean “fence” here (but it is obviously not a cognate of the Sindarin term iâth “fence”).It may mean “girdle”; compare Sindarin Lest Melian as a name of the Girdle of Melian (WJ:225, 228), suggesting*“Girdle-land” as the meaning of Lestanórë. 
	leuca (1) noun "snake" (Appendix E)
	**leuca ("k") (2) a misreading for lenca (q.v.) that appears in the Etymologies as printed in LR; cf. VT45:27. 
	 lev- verb “move” (intransitive) (PE16:132)
	-li partitive pl. ending (simply called a plural suffix in the Etymologies, stem LI). The ending is used to indicate a plural that is neither generic (e.g. Eldar “the Elves” as a race) nor definite (preceded by article); hence Eldali is used for “some Elves” (a particular group of Elves, when they are first mentioned in a narrative, VT49:8). Sometimes Tolkien also lets -li imply a great number; in PE17:129, the form falmalinnar from Namárië is broken down as falma-li-nnar “foam wave-many-towards-pl. ending”, and falmali by itself Tolkien translated “many waves” (PE17:73). A distinct accusative in -lī seems to occur in the phrase an i falmalī (PE17:127, apparently meaning the same as i falmalinnar, but replacing the allative ending with a preposition). Genitive -lion in vanimálion, malinornélion (q.v. for reference), allative -linna and -linnar in falmalinnar, q.v. The endings for other cases are only known from the Plotz letter: possessive -líva, dative -lin, locative -lissë or -lissen, ablative -lillo or -lillon, instrumental -línen, "short locative" -lis. When the noun ends in a consonant, r and n is assimilated before l, e.g. Casalli as the partitive pl. of Casar “Dwarf” (WJ:402), or elelli as the partitive pl. of elen “star” (PE17:127). It is unclear whether the same happens in monosyllabic words, or whether a connecting vowel would be slipped in before -li (e.g. ?queneli or ?quelli as the partitive pl. of quén, quen- “person”). 
	li-, lin- a multiplicative prefix (LT1:269)
	lia noun "fine thread, spider filament" (SLIG). 
lia- vb. "twine" (LT1:271)
	liantassë noun "vine" (LT1:271)
	liantë (1) noun "spider" (SLIG),  in earlier sources ascribed other meanings:(2) liantë "tendril" (LT1:271) and (3) “vine” (PE14:55, cf. liantassë elsewhere)
	líco ("k") noun "wax" (Markirya comments, MC:223). The related noun lícuma "candle" suggests that líco has the stem-form lícu-.
	lícuma ("k") noun "taper, candle"
	lië noun "people" (LI, Narqelion, VT39:6), in Eldalië, losselië, Ornelië (q.v.); possessive #liéva in Mindon Eldaliéva (q.v.); maybe also compounded in #rohtalië, #ruhtalië (q.v.)
	lil adverbial particle "more" (PE14:80)
	lillassëa adj. "having many leaves", pl. lillassië in Markirya (ve tauri lillassië, lit. *"like many-leaved forests", is translated "like leaves of forests" in MC:215). The lil- element is clearly an assimilated form of lin-, # 1, q.v.

	limba noun "a drop" (LIB1)
	limbë (1) adj. (stem limbi-, given primitive form ¤lĭmbĭ) “quick, swift” (PE17:18)
	limbë (2) adj. "many", probably obsoleted by #1 above (LT2:342)
	#limë (stem *limi-) noun "link", isolated from málimë, q.v.
	limil noun “chain” (QL:54)
	limpa adj. “frail, slender and drooping” (PE17:168)
	limpë noun "(wine), drink of the Valar" (LIP), cf. the early "Qenya" gloss "drink of the fairies" (LT1:258)
	lin, lind- noun "a musical sound" (Letters:308), "melody" (LT1:258). Compare lindë.
	lin- (1) (prefix) "many" (LI), seen in lindornëa, lintyulussëa; assimilated lil- in lillassëa.
	[lin- (2) vb. "sing" (GLIN, struck out)]
	linda adj. "fair, beautiful" (of sound) (SLIN, LIND; VT45:27), “soft, gentle, light” (PE16:96), “beautiful, sweet, melodious of sound” (PE17:150); for Linda as a noun, see Lindar.
	lindalë noun "music". Cf. Ainulindalë "Music of the Ainur". (The word is cited as lindelë in the printed Etymologies, entry LIN2, but according to VT45:27, this is a misreading for lindalë in Tolkien's manuscript.) The word lindalë may argue the existence of a verbal stem #linda- "sing, make music".
Lindar noun "Singers" (sg. Linda), what the Teleri called themselves (WJ:380, MR:349, UT:253, 286). It seems that Lindar is also interpreted "the Beautiful" (cf. the common adj. linda "fair, beautiful"), but this interpretation apparently belongs primarily to Tolkien's earlier conception, when Lindar was the name of the First Clan, the name of which he revised to Vanyar (similarly meaning "the Fair"). Adj. Lindarin = Telerin (but Tolkien of course held it to be = Vanyarin when the First Clan, the later Vanyar, were still called Lindar – before he decided to apply this name to the third clan, the Teleri) (TĀ/TA3)
	lindë noun "air, tune, singing, song" (SA:gond, (LIN2, [GLIN]); lindelorendor "music-dream-land"; see laurelindórenan lindelorendor... (LotR2:III ch. 4, cf. Letters:308). Also compare lindi- in lindimaitar, q.v. (but the other compounds here cited do not give a lindë a stem-form lindi-).
	lindë- vb. ?"sing" (LT1:258; in LotR-style Quenya lir- or #linda-)
	lindelë noun "music" (LIN2, LT1:258 – lindalë in Ainulindalë). According to VT45:27, lindelë in the printed Etymologies (entry LIN2) is a misreading for lindalë in Tolkien's manuscript. 
	lindelëa adj. "melodious" (LT1:258)
	Lindi pl. noun: what the Green-elves (Laiquendi, Nandor) called themselves; also used in Exilic Quenya (WJ:385)
	lindimaitar noun “composer, musician” (PE17:163). Compare lindë, maitar. 
	Lindissë fem.name, perhaps lin- (root of words having to do with song/music) + (n)dissë "woman" (see nís). (UT:210)

	lindornëa adj. "having many oak-trees" (DÓRON, LI)
	línë noun "cobweb" (SLIG). Since Tolkien eventually decided that roots in sl- yield Quenya words in hl- (though this was pronounced l- in late Exilic Quenya), it may be that the spelling *hlínë is to be preferred.
	-línen ending for partitive pl. instrumental (Plotz); see -li

	linquë ("q") (1) adj. "wet" (LINKWI). In early "Qenya", this word was glossed "water" (LT1:262), and "wet" was linqui or liquin, q.v.
	linquë (2) noun  *"grass, reed" (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator p. 199, note 34)
	linquë (3) noun “hyacinth” (plant, not jewel) (PE17:62). The wording in the source is not altogether clear; it is said that the word lassë (leaf) “would not e.g. be used of leaf of a hyacinth (linque)”. If linquë is not the term for a hyacinth, it must refer to the kind of leaf a hyacinth has. Compare #2 above.
	linqui ("q") adj. "wet" (MC:216; Tolkien's later Quenya has linquë.)
	linta adj. "swift"; pl. lintë attested (PE17:63. Nam, RGEO:66) Cf. lintië.
	lintië noun “swiftness, speed” derived from linta; also used as adverb “quickly”, nornë lintië “he ran with swiftness”, also more explicitly with pronominal suffixes and the instrumental ending -nen:  lintieryanen “with his speed” (PE17:58)

	lís (“lîs”) noun “honey”, “oblique līr- but usually from stem liss-“ (PE17:154). Compare the reading in the Etymologies: lis (liss-, e.g. dat.sg. lissen) (LIS; Tolkien originally wrote lissë, VT45:28)
	liscë ("k") noun "reed, sedge" (LT2:335)
	lissë adj. "sweet" (Nam, RGEO:66); also noun  "sweetness", used metaphorically for "grace" (VT43:29, VT44:18); in this sense the word may be compounded as #Erulissë, q.v. Genitive lissëo in VT44:18. - In the entry LIS in the Etymologies, Tolkien originally gave lissë as the noun "honey", but then changed it to lis with stem liss- (VT45:28)

	litsë noun "sand" (LIT)
	-líva ending for partitive pl. possessive (Plotz); see -li
	lívë noun "sickness" (SLIW). Since Tolkien eventually decided that roots in sl- yield Quenya words in hl- (though this was pronounced l- in late Exilic Quenya), it may be that the spelling *hlívë is to be preferred.
	liyúmë noun "host" (VT48:32) 
	-llë (1) “one of several suffixes indicating feminine agent”, as in Tintallë “kindler” vs. the verb tinta- “to kindle”. In the source (PE17:69) Tolkien noted that -llë was little used because of the clash with the pronominal ending -llë (see #2 below), but the latter ending was later revised.
	-llë (2) abandoned pronominal ending “you”, 2nd person pl. (VT49:48); Tolkien later revised this ending to -ldë. 
	-llo (1) “ablative adverbial suffix” (PE17:72) implying "from" or "out of", as in sindanóriello "out of a grey land", Rómello "from the East" (Nam), Mardello *"from Earth" (FS), ulcullo "from evil" (VT43:12), sillumello "from this hour" (VT44:35), yello *"from whom" (VT47:21), Manwello *”from Manwë” (VT49:24), Melcorello / Melkorello “from Melkor” (VT49:7, 24). Pl. -llon (so in Plotz) or -llor (in illon, elenillor, raxellor, elendellor, q.v.); dual -lto (Plotz). A shorter form of the ablative ending, -lo, apparently occurs in the words silo “hence” and talo “from there”, q.v. In the Etymologies, Tolkien cited the Quenya ablative ending as -ello, evidently including the connecting vowel -e- that may be inserted when the ending is added to a word ending in a consonant (VT45:28), compare Melcorello. See also ló, lo #2.
	[-llo (2) “you”, dual; abandoned pronominal ending. Also written -illo. (VT49:49)]
	-lma pronominal ending “our”, 1st person pl. exclusive (VT49:16), also attested (with the genitive ending -o that displaces final -a) in the word omentielmo "of our meeting" (nominative omentielma, PE17:58). Tolkien emended omentielmo to omentielvo in the Second Edition of LotR, reflecting a revision of the Quenya pronominal system (cf. VT49:38, 49, Letters:447). The cluster -lm- in the endings for inclusive "we/our" was altered to -lv- (VT43:14). In the revised system, -lma should apparently signify exclusive "our".
	-lmë 1st person pl. pronominal ending: "we" (VT49:38; 51 carilmë *”we do”, VT49:16). It was originally intended to be inclusive "we" (VT49:48), including the person(s) spoken to, but by 1965 Tolkien made this the ending for exclusive "we" instead (cf. the changed definition of the corresponding possessive ending -lma, see above). (VT49:38) Exemplified in laituvalmet "we shall bless them" (lait-uva-lme-t "bless-shall-we-them") (the meaning apparently changed from inclusive to exclusive “we”, VT49:55), see also nalmë under ná# 1. (LotR3:VI ch. 4, translated in Letters:308)
	-lmo “we (two)”, abandoned pronominal ending for the 1st person dual inclusive (later revised by Tolkien to -ngwë). This -lmo was listed as an alternative to -ngo (VT49:48).
	-lto ending for dual ablative (Plotz)
	ló (1) noun "night, a night" (DO3/DŌ, VT45:28)
	ló, lo (2) prep. “from”, also used = “by” introducing the agent after a passive construction: nahtana ló Turin *“slain by Túrin” (VT49:24). A similar and possibly identical form is mentioned in the Etymologies as being somehow related to the ablative ending -llo, but is not there clearly defined (VT45:28). At one point, Tolkien suggested that lo rather than the ending -llo was used with proper names (lo Manwë rather than Manwello for “from Manwë”), but this seems to have been a short-lived idea (VT49:24).
	loa, noun literally "growth", used of a solar year (= coranar) when seasonal changes are considered (Appendix D; in PM:126 loa is translated "time of growth". Pl. loar, or "löar", in MR:426) The form loa is also mentioned as the hypothetical Quenya cognate of Sindarin lô ("swampy"), but precisely because it clashed with loa "year", this Quenya cognate was not in use (VT42:10)
	loar noun “(golden) blossom” (not to be confused with the pl. form of loa). Also lávar. (PE17:159)
	loc- ("lok-") verb? noun? "bend, loop". (May be a primitive stem rather than Quenya.) (SA:lok)
	lócë ("k") noun "dragon, snake, serpent, drake", older hlócë ("k") (SA:lok-, LT2:340, LOK; in the Etymologies the word is followed by "-ī", whatever that is supposed to mean) 
locta- ("k") vb. "sprout, put forth leaves or flowers" (LT1:258; this would have to become *lohta- in LotR-style Quenya, but later forms like losta- "to bloom" and tuia- "to sprout, spring" are to be preferred.)
	loctë ("k") noun "blossom (of flowers in bunches or clusters)" (LT1:258; this would have to become *lohtë in LotR-style Quenya)
	loëndë noun *"year-middle", the middle (183rd) day of the year, inserted between the months of Nárië and Cermië (June and July) in the Númenórean calendar and the Steward's Reckoning (Appendix D)
	*lohta- see locta-

	loicarë (“k”) noun “mistaken action” (PE17:151)
	loico noun "corpse, dead body" (so in Markirya; Etym also has quelet of similar meaning)
loicolícuma noun "corpse-candle" (Markirya)
	[Loicorin], possibly a synonym of Ilcorin, q.v. (VT45:29)
	loima noun “a mistake” (PE17:151)
	loiparë noun “a mistake in writing” (PE17:151). Cf. parma. 
	loiquetë noun “a mistake in speech” (PE17:151)
	loita- vb. “miss, fail, fall short of” (transitive). (PE17:151)
	lom- vb. "hide" (LT1:255; given in the form lomir "I hide"; read *lomin if the word is to be adapted to LotR-style Quenya.)
	lomba adj. or noun "secret" (LT1:255)
	lómë noun "dusk, twilight", also "night"; according to SD:415, the stem is lómi- (contrast the "Qenya" genitive lómen rather than **lómin in VT45:28). According to PE17:152, lómë refers to ‘night’ “when viewed favourably, as a rule, but it became the general rule” (cf. SD:414-415 regarding lōmi as an Adûnaic loan-word based on lómë, meaning “fair night, a night of stars” with “no connotations of gloom or fear”). In the battle-cry auta i lómë “the night is passing” (Silm. ch. 20), the “night” would however seem to refer metaphorically to the reign of Morgoth. As for the gloss, cf. Lómion masc. name "Child of Twilight [dusk]", the Quenya name Aredhel secretly gave to Maeglin (SA). Otherwise lómë is usually defined as "night" (Letters:308, LR:41, SD:302 cf.414-15, SA:dú); the Etymologies defines lómë as "Night [as phenomenon], night-time, shades of night, Dark" (DO3/DŌ, LUM, DOMO, VT45:28), or "night-light" (VT45:28, reading of lómë uncertain). In early "Qenya" the gloss was "dusk, gloom, darkness" (LT1:255). Cf. lómelindë pl. lómelindi "nightingale" (SA:dú, LR:41; SD:302, MR:172, DO3/DŌ, LIN2, TIN). Derived adjective #lómëa "gloomy" in Lómëanor "Gloomyland"; see Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna...
	#lómëa adj. "gloomy"; see Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna...
	lómëar noun "child of gloom" (pl. evidently Lómëarni) (LT1:255, 259)
	lómi noun "clouds" (MC:214; this is "Qenya"; in LotR-style Quenya it would evidently be the pl. of lómë) 
	lómin noun "shade, shadow" (LT1:255)
	lón, lónë (pl. lóni given) noun "deep pool", "river-[?feeding] well" (the second gloss was not certainly legible). A rejected paragraph in Tolkien's manuscript defined the word as "deep pool or lake" (VT48:28, PE17:137)
	lóna (1) noun "pool, mere" (VT42:10). Variant of lón, lónë above?
	lóna (2) noun "island, remote land difficult to reach" (LONO (AWA) ). Obsoleted by #1 above?
	[lóna (3) unused adj., a form Tolkien mentioned as the hypothetical Quenya cognate of Sindarin loen, Telerin logna adj. "soaking wet" (VT42:10), but this cognate was not in use because it clashed with #1 above. At this point, Tolkien may seem to have forgotten lóna #2.]
	?lóna (4) adj. "dark" (DO3/DŌ). If this is to be the cognate of "Noldorin"/Sindarin dûr, as the context seems to indicate, lóna is likely a misreading for *lóra in Tolkien's manuscript.
	[londa noun "path"], changed by Tolkien to londë noun "road (in sea)" (VT45:28)
	londë noun "land-locked haven" (cf. #lóndië “harbourage”), “gulf” (TI:423). In Alqualondë "Swan-haven" (SA), "Haven of Swan" (VT45:28), Hirilondë ship-name "Haven-finder" (UT:192). In the Etymologies, londë is glossed "road (in sea), entrance to harbour" (LOD) and also "fairway" (VT45:28), i.e. a navigable channel for ships. In VT42:10, where the stem is given as LON rather than LOD, the gloss is simply "haven".
	#londië noun “harbourage” (PE17:28)
	lor- "to slumber" (LT1:259; the corresponding abstract noun lórë "slumber" is attested in Tolkien's later Quenya, so this verb must still be valid). Cf. also lor "dream" (Letters:308; probably just an Elvish "element" rather than a complete word)
	-lóra ending "-less, without", as in ómalóra "voiceless" (VT45:28)
	#lóralya adj. "asleep" (VT14:5; this is "Qenya"; in Tolkien's later Quenya rather lorna)
	lorda adj. "drowsy, slumbrous" (LT1:259)
	lórë noun "slumber" (LOS), “dream” (PE17:80)
	Lórellin place-name, the lake where the Valië Estë sleeps; apparently meaning *"Dream-lake" or *"Slumber-lake" (Silm) 
	Lórien (from lor-, q.v.), place-name also used as the name of a Vala, properly the place where he dwells, whereas his real name is Irmo (WJ:402, LOS (ÓLOS, SPAN) ). Alternative forms Lorien (with a short o) and Lorion, MR:144.
	lorna adj. "asleep" (LOS)  
	lós (þ?) noun “flower” (PE17:26). If this is to be the cognate of Sindarin loth, as the source suggests, the older Quenya form would be *lóþ. 
	[losca, loxa adj. “brown of hair” (PE17:155)]
	lossë (1) noun  "snow" or adj. "snow-white" (SA:los, MC:213, VT42:18); losselië noun "white people" (MC:216, PE16:96)
lossë (2) noun "blossom" ("usually, owing to association with olosse snow, only used of white blossom") (LOT(H) ) 
lossëa adj. "snow-white" (so in VT42:18; this would be an adjective derived from lossë "snow", but elsewhere, Tolkien implies that lossë itself can also be used as an adjective "snow-white"; see lossë #1 above)
	losselië noun "white people" (MC:216, PE16:96)
losta- vb. "to bloom" (VT42:18)
	lótë noun "flower", mostly applied to larger single flowers (LOT(H), LT1:259, VT42:18). (The shorter form -lot occurs in compounds, e.g. fúmellot, q.v.) In the names Ninquelóte *"White-flower" (= Nimloth), Vingilótë "Foam-flower", the name of Eärendil's ship (SA:loth), also in Lótessë fifth month of the year, "May" (Appendix D). See also olótë, lotsë.
	lótefalmarínen inflected compound "with waves crowned with flowers" (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
lotsë noun "small single flower" (VT42:18)
	[loxa , losca adj. “brown of hair” (PE17:155)]
	loxë (1) ("ks") noun "hair" (LOK). In later sources Tolkien uses findë, findessë, findilë for "hair", leaving the conceptual status of loxë uncertain.
	loxë (2) noun "bunch, cluster" (QL:55). Perhaps compare #1. 
-lta (and -ltya), 3rd person pl. pronominal possessive suffix “their”, alternating with -nta/-ntya in Tolkien’s writings (VT49:16, 17), just as the ending -ltë “they” also has the variant -ntë. According to VT49:17, the ending -lta or -ltya will appear as -ilta, -iltya following a consonant; other sources rather point to -e- as the connecting vowel in such cases (VT49:17).
-ltë, 3rd person pl. pronominal suffix, “they” (VT49:51; cariltë “they do”, VT49:16, 17). It alternates with -ntë in Tolkien’s manuscripts (VT49:17, 57). In his early material, the ending also appears as  -lto, occurring in Fíriel's Song (meldielto "they are beloved" and cárielto "they made"), also in LT1:114: tulielto "they have come" (cf. VT49:57). Compare -lta, -ltya as the ending for “their”.
-lto, “Qenya” pronominal ending “they”; see -ltë
	lú noun "a time, occasion" (LU)
	#lucando (also #lucindo) noun "debtor, one who trespasses" (VT43:20; the words are attested in the plural: lucandor, lucindor). 
	#lucassë noun "debt, trespass" (VT43:19, attested in the pl. with a pronominal suffix: lucassemmar "our trespasses")
	lúcë ("k") noun "enchantment" (LUK)
	#lucië noun "debt, trespass" (VT43:19, attested in the pl. with a pronominal suffix: luciemmar "our trespasses")
	#lucindo, see #lucando
	luhta- (1) vb. "to enchant" (LUK, VT45:29)
	luhta- (2) vb. "to bow" (VT47:35); this intransitive verb can be distinguished from luhta- "enchant" above, since #1 is transitive and will always have a direct object, something #2 never has.
	[#luhta (3) noun  "debt, trespass" (VT43:19, attested in the pl. form luhtar, but deleted by Tolkien)]
	luimë noun "flood" (VT48:23, 30; the additional glosses "floodwater, flooded land" were struck out, VT48:30), "flood, high tide" (VT48:24, 30). According to VT48:30, partially illegible glosses in Tolkien's manuscript may also suggest that luimë can be used for any tide, or for the spring tide (the maximum tide just after a new or full moon). 
	[luina] adj. "pale" (VT45:30)
	luinë adj. "blue", pl. luini (PE17:66, VT48:23, 24, 28, Nam, RGEO:66). Common Eldarin luini- would also be the stem-form in Quenya (VT48:24). Compare *luinincë. Apparently -luin in Illuin, the name of one of the Lamps of the Valar (q.v.), Helluin, name of the star Sirius, and Luinil, name of another blue-shining star (or planet). (SA; Luinil is tentatively identified with Neptune, MR:435). Cf. also menelluin *"sky-blue", used as noun = "cornflower" (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator p. 193).
	*luinincë (luininci-) ("k") adj. "bluish". The form is given as "luininki" with the last vowel marked as short; this would be the etymological form underlying Quenya *luinincë (VT48:18)
	luita- vb. "to flood" (VT48:22), "to flood, inundate, drench" (VT48:30; the latter glosses come from a note that was struck out)
	lúlë noun "sapphire" (QL:57)
	lumba (1) adj. "weary" (VT45:29)
	lumba (2) adj. “gloomy” (PE17:72)
	Lumbar name of a star (or planet), tentatively identified with Saturn (MR:435), evidently connected to lumbo, lumbulë (Silm)
	lumbë noun "gloom, shadow" (LUM)
	lumbo noun "cloud" (pl. lumbor in Markirya), also glossed “gloom; dark, shade” (PE17:72, 168). In early "Qenya", lumbo was glossed "dark lowering cloud" (LT1:259)
	lumbulë noun "(heavy) shadow" (Nam, RGEO:67, PE17:168)
	lúmë (1) noun "time" (LU, PE17:168) or "hour", locative lúmessë (VT43:34), pl. locative lúmissen “at the times” (VT49:47), allative lúmenna "upon the hour", elided lúmenn' in the greeting elen síla lúmenn' omentielvo "a star shines upon the hour of our meeting", because the next word begins with a similar vowel. The complete form lúmenna omentielvo is found in WJ:367 and Letters:425 (footnote). Cf. also the compounds lumenyárë and lúmequenta, q.v.; see also #sillumë.
	lúmë (2) noun "darkness" (one wonders if Tolkien confused lúmë "time, hour" and lómë "night") (Markirya)
	lumenyárë noun "history, chronological account" (NAR2 - read *lúmenyárë?) According to VT45:36, the manuscript spelling actually seems to be lumennyáre, but Hostetter and Wynne conclude that this is "probably a slip": The double nn would be difficult to justify.
	lúmequenta ("q") noun "history, chronological account" (LU)
	lúmequentalë ("q") noun "history" (LU, KWET). According to VT45:29, the accent marking the ú as a long vowel is actually missing in the entry LU in Tolkien's original Etymologies manuscript; yet it is apparently included both in the entry KWET and in the related words lúmequenta and lúmequentalëa; its omission in the entry LU is therefore probably just a slip.
	lúmequentalëa ("q") adj. "historical" (LU)
	lumna adj. "lying heavy, burdensome, oppressive, ominous" (DUB). 
	lumna- stative vb. "be heavy" (LR:47, SD:310; cf. lumna- "to lie heavy" in the Etymologies, stem DUB-). A form lúvë was mentioned in connection with this verb, possibly a strong past tense form directly derived from the root DUB- (primitive *dūbē), but Tolkien struck it out (VT45:11).
	lún adj.??? a word of obscure meaning, perhaps "deep" as used of water (VT48:28)
	lúna adj. *“dark” in Lúnaturco and Taras Lúna, Quenya names of Barad-dûr (Dark Tower). (PE17:22). In the Etymologies, lúnë “blue” was changed by Tolkien from lúna (VT45:29).
	[lúna] (2), see lúnë
	lunca noun "wain" (VT43:19), “heavy transport wain” (PE17:28). #Ondolunca ”stone-wain”, see under ondo.
	lúnë (stem *lúni-, given the primitive form ¤lugni) adj. "blue" (LUG2, LT1:262; later sources rather give luinë, with pl. form luini in Namárië). According to VT45:29, lúnë in the Etymologies was changed by Tolkien from lúna.
	lúnelinquë ("q") adj.  *"blue-wet" (?), translated "surging" (MC:213, 220; this is "Qenya") 
	lunga adj. "heavy" (LUG1). Curiously, the variant lungu- appears in certain compounds; see Lungumá, lungumaitë.
	lunganar adj. "sagged" (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	lunganë adj. "bending" (MC:214; this is "Qenya")
	Lungumá, Lungumaqua masc. name "Heavyhand", equivalent of Sindarin Mablung (VT47:19)
	lungumaitë adj. "heavyhanded" (VT47:19, VT49:32, PE17:162)
	Lúnoronti noun "Blue Mountains" (LUG2)
	luntë noun "boat" (LUT, MC:216), "ship" (LT1:249, LT1:255) 
	lúrë noun "dark weather" (LT1:259)
	lúrëa adj. "dark, overcast" (LT1:259)
	lúsina adj. “glowing” (of things), “hearty” (of people) (QL:57). If this word is to be used in LotR-style Quenya, one would have to assume that it represents older *lúþina and is derived from a root *LUTH.
	lussa- vb. "to whisper" (SLUS/SRUS). Since Tolkien eventually decided that roots in sl- yield Quenya words in hl- (though this was pronounced l- in late Exilic Quenya), it may be that the spelling *hlussa- is to be preferred.
	lussë noun "a whispering sound" (SLUS/SRUS). Since Tolkien eventually decided that roots in sl- yield Quenya words in hl- (though this was pronounced l- in late Exilic Quenya), it may be that the spelling *hlussë is to be preferred. 
	lusta adj. "void, empty" (LUS)  
	lútë noun "sail" (MC:213; this is "Qenya")
	lútier vb. in pa.t.? "sailed" (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	lúto noun "flood" (LT1:249)
	lutta- vb. "flow, float" (LT1:249)
	lutu- vb. "flow, float" (LT1:249)
lúva noun "bow, bight; bend, bow, curve" (Appendix E, PE17:122, 168). The reference is to a "bow" as part of written characters and other uses, but “not for shooting” (a bow used to shoot arrows is called quinga, possibly also cú if the latter term is used as in Sindarin). 
	[lúvë, see lumna-]
	luvu- vb. "lower, brood" (LT1:259)
	luxo (luxu-) noun “mud” (QL:56)
	-lv- element in pronominal endings for inclusive plural "we/our" (VT43:14). Iincludes the old 1st pl. inclusive stem we (VT48:10). Omentielvo "of our meeting" (q.v.) includes the ending #-lva "our" with the genitive ending -o attached. The corresponding ending for inclusive "we" is perhaps normally -lvë in late exilic Quenya; the variant form -lwë occurs in the verbs carilwë “we do” (VT49:16), navilwë "we judge" (VT42:34); according to VT48:11 this may simply be the older (pre-Exilic) form of *-lvë (VT49:51 lists the ending for “we” as “-lwe, -lve”, apparently the older and the younger form). 
	-lwa, possessive pronominal ending, 1st person pl. inclusive “our” (VT49:16), later (in exilic Quenya) used in the form #-lva, genitive -lvo in omentielvo (see -lv-).
	-lwë, later -lvë, pronominal ending “we” (VT49:51), 1st person pl. inclusive ending, occurring in the verbs carilwë “we do” (VT49:16) and navilwë (see #nav-). The ending became -lvë in later, Exilic Quenya (VT49:51). See -lv-.
	lyá ??? (Narqelion)
	-lya 2nd person sg. formal/polite pronominal suffix "thy, your" (VT49:16, 38, 48). In tielyanna "upon your path" (UT:22 cf. 51), caritalya(s) "your doing (it)" (VT41:17), esselya "thy name" (VT43:14), onnalya “your child” (VT49:41, 42), parma-restalyanna *“upon your book-fair” (VT49:38), and, in Tolkien's Quenya Lord's Prayer, in the various translations of "thy kingdom": aranielya in the final version, earlier turinastalya, túrinastalya, turindielya, túrindielya (VT43:15). Also in indómelya (changed from mendelya) "thy will" (VT43:15-16)
	lye pron. “thou/thee, you”, 2nd person sg. formal/polite (corresponding to familiar/intimate tye, q.v.) (VT49:36) It seems the original stem-form was le (VT49:50), distinct from de as a plural “you”, but when initial d became l and the forms threatened to fall together, le was apparently altered to lye by analogy with the ending -lyë and the emphatic pronoun elyë. Stressed lyé (VT49:51). For lye as object, cf. nai Eru lye mánata “God bless you” (VT49:39). Allative lyenna *”to you, upon you” (VT49:40-41). Compare the reflexive pronoun imlë *"yourself, thyself", q.v. (it did not have to be *imlyë, for the corresponding pl. pronoun indë “yourselves” is distinct anyhow).
	-lyë pronominal ending “thou, you” (VT49:48), 2nd person sg. formal/polite: hiruvalyë "thou shalt find" (Nam, RGEO:67), carilyë *“you do” (VT49:16). Long form of -l, q.v. The ending also occurs in alyë, the imperative particle a with a pronominal suffix (VT43:17); see a #3. The intimate/familiar ending corresponding to polite/formal -lyë is -tyë, q.v

<M>
ma, (1) neuter personal pronoun "something, a thing" (VT42:34). It may occur (with the meaning “thing”) in the ejaculation yé mána (ma) = “what a blessing” or “what a good thing!”“ (VT49:41) (2) Ma has also been theorized to be a particle used to turn declarative statements into yes/no questions.
	má noun "hand" (MA3, LT2:339, Narqelion, VT39:10, [VT45:30], VT47:6, 18, 19); the dual "a pair of hands" is attested both by itself as mát (VT47:6) and with a pronominal suffix as máryat "his/her (pair of) hands" (see -rya, -t) (Nam, RGEO:67). The nominative plural form was only máli, not **már (VT47:6), though plurals in -r may occur in some of the cases, as indicated by the pl. allative mannar "into hands" (FS). Mánta “their hand”, dual mántat “their hands” (two hands each) (PE17:161). Cf. also the compounds mátengwië "language of the hands" (VT47:9) and Lungumá "Heavyhand" (VT47:19); also compare the adj. -maitë "-handed". See also málimë.
	#mac- ("k") vb. "hew with a sword" (VT39:11, where the aorist macë is given); cf. early "Qenya" mac- ("k") "slay" (LT1:259)
	maca- ("k") vb. "to forge metal" (which rang at the stokes of hammers). (VT41:10; in this source this is suggested as the origin of the word macil "sword", but mac- above would also seem to be relevant, so Tolkien may have changed his mind about the precise etymology of macil.)
máca pron. "each, every" (GL:41); rather ilya in Tolkien's later Quenya
Macalaurë ("k"), masc. name, the mother-name (never used in narrative) of Canafinwë = Maglor (PM:353, MAK); his Sindarin name is seen to be based on his mother-name. In the Etymologies, Macalaurë is interpreted "Gold-cleaver" (MAK)
	macar ("k") (1) noun "swordsman" (VT39:11). In Menelmacar (see menel). According to VT41:10, macar is literally "forger" (derived from maca-, q.v.), "often used in later use of a warrior".
	macar ("k") (2) noun "tradesman" (MBAKH)
	macil ("k") noun "sword" (MAK, LT1:259, VT39:11, VT45:32, VT49:17); macilya “his (or their) sword” (PE17:130), see -ya #4. 
	mahalma noun "throne", nominative pl. mahalmar "thrones" and locative pl. mahalmassen in CO. Adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:399)
	Máhan (pl. Máhani attested in WJ:402), noun: one of the eight chiefs of the Valar (adopted and adapted from Valarin, but usually translated as Aratar). Máhanaxar the "Doom Ring" of Aman; adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)
	mahta- (1) vb. "wield a weapon”, “fight" (MAK), "to handle, wield, manage" (VT39:11, VT47:18), also "deal with" (VT47:6, 19, VT49:10). Past tense mahtanë is attested (VT49:10). In an earlier version of the entry MAK in the Etymologies, Tolkien first glossed mahta- as "slay [or kill] with sword", then changed it to "fight with sword" (VT45:30-32)
	[mahta-] (2) vb.  "trade", changed by Tolkien to manca-, q.v. (VT45:33)
	mahtar noun "warrior" (MAK; original gloss "swordsman", VT45:32)
	mai (1) adv. "well" (VT47:6), apparently also used as prefix (PE17:17:162, 163, 172)
	mai (2) conj. "if" (PE14:59 cf. VT49:20; possibly obsoleted by #1 above; for “if”, Tolkien later used qui)
Maia pl. Maiar noun "the Beautiful" (MR:49), the lesser (= non-Vala) Ainur that entered Eä. Variant Máya in VT42:13/VT47:18, pl. Máyar in PM:363, 364 and VT47:18 (possibly, Máya is to be understood as the older form of Maia). With negative prefix ú- also Úmaiar, Maiar who became evil and followed Melkor, such as Balrogs (MR:79, "Umaiar", MR:165).
	maica (1) ("k") adj. "sharp, piercing" (SA:maeg), cf. hendumaica and the noun maica below.
  	maica (2) ("k") noun "blade of a cutting tool or weapon, especially sword-blade" (VT39:11)
	mailë noun "lust" (MIL-IK) 
	mailëa adj. "lustful" (MIL-IK)
	maira adj. “admirable, excellent, precious”; “splendid, sublime” (“only of great, august or splendid things”) (PE17:163, 172). Cf. Mairon.
	mairë noun “work of high and beautiful art” (or the process of producing a work) (PE17:163)
	mairëa adj. “beautiful” (of things made by art) (PE17:163). An alternative (and peculiar) form “mairia” is also implied in the source.
	Mairen fem. name  (UT:210), initial element perhaps related or identical to mai "well". The second element is obscure; the root REN "recall, have in mind" (PM:372) could be related; if so the name may imply "well remembered", "(of) good memory" or something similar. It may also connect with the adj. maira, q.v. and compare the masc. name Mairon (PE18:163).
mairo noun "horse" (GL:56; later sources have rocco, olombo)
Mairon, masc. name “the Admirable” (cf. adj. maira), said to be the original name of Sauron, changed when he was suborned by Melkor, “but he continued to call himself Mairon the Admirable, or Tar-mairon ‘King Excellent’, until after the downfall of Númenor” (PE17:183). Since Sauron had joined Melkor before the Elves came to Valinor and developed the Quenya language, we are perhaps to understand that Mairon is a translation by sense of Sauron’s original Valarin name, though Sauron himself may seem to have used the Elvish form in Middle-earth and on Númenor.
maita (1) adj. "hungry" (VT39:11)
maita- (2) transitive vb. “to make with art, design, compose” (PE17:163). Cf. maitar, maitalë.
maitalë noun “the act (not the result) of doing work of art” (PE17:163)
	maitar noun “artist” (by itself usually: a poet), also compounded in lindimaitar “composer, musician”, nyarnamaitar “storyteller”, ondomaitar “sculptor in stone”, (PE17:163)
	maitë (stem *maiti-, given the primitive form ¤ma3iti) adj. "handed” or “handy, skillful” (VT49:32, 42) in Angamaitë, hyarmaitë, lungumaitë, morimaitë, Telemmaitë, q.v. Etym gives maitë pl. maisi "handy, skilled" (MA3), but Tolkien later eliminated the variation t/s (compare ataformaitë “ambidextrous”, pl. ataformaiti).
	Maitimo noun "well-shaped one", mother-name (never used in narrative) of Nelyafinwë = Maedhros (PM:353)
	maivoinë noun "great longing" (LT2:345)
	maiwë noun "gull" (MIW), pl. maiwi in Markirya. Cf. also the "Qenya" pl. maiwin "gulls" (MC:213)
	mal conj. "but" (VT43:23)
	mala- vb. "hurt, pain" (QL:63)
	Malantur, masc. name. Apparently includes -(n)tur "lord, ruler". The initial element is unlikely to connect with the early "Qenya" element mala- "hurt, pain", and may rather reflect the root MALAT "gold" (PM:366): Malat-ntur > Malantur "Gold-ruler"? (UT:210)
	malarauco noun "balrog, demon" (RUK - rather valarauco in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	malcanë ("k") noun "torture" (LT1:250)
	Malcaraucë noun "balrog", also Valkaraucë ("k") (LT1:250; in Tolkien's later Quenya Valarauco)
	malda adj. “yellow, of golden colour” (PE17:51), variant of malina. An earlier source (the Etymologies, entry SMAL) has malda as the noun “gold” – but LotR gives malta, q.v., and according to VT46:14 the form malta originally appeared in the Etymologies as well. Since Quenya sometimes uses adjectives as nouns (see for instance fanya), malda could still be regarded as a valid side-form of the noun malta “gold”.
	maldornë noun (fictional species of tree, Sindarin mallorn). Variant of malinornë (apparently arising by shortening to *malnornë and the normal development ln > ld, unless the shorter adjective malda is present from the beginning). (PE17:51)
 	málimë (stem *málimi-, given primitive form ¤mā-limi) noun "wrist", literally "hand-link" (má + #limë). (VT47:6)
	malina adj. "yellow" (SMAL, Letters:308), “yellow, of golden colour” (PE17:51). Malinalda *"Yellow-tree", a name of Laurelin (SA:mal-; evidently malina + alda), translated "Tree of Gold" in the Silmarillion index. Cf. also malinornë. 
	malinai ??? (Narqelion)
malinornë noun “yellow-tree” (malina + ornë), fictional species of tree (Sindarin mallorn; in Quenya also called maldornë) (PE17:50). Cf. malinornélion "of yellow-trees"; see laurelindórenan lindelorendor... (LotR2:III ch. 4; cf. Letters:308). Malinornélion is partitive pl. genitive of malinornë (UT:167, normal pl. malinorni, UT:168).
	mallë pl. maller noun "street, road" (MBAL, LR:47, 56, LT1:263, SD:310)
	málo noun "friend" (MEL, VT49:22)
	malo (1) (stem *malu-, given the primitive form ¤smalu) noun "pollen, yellow powder" (SMAL)
	malo (2) (*malu-, pl. malwi) noun “moth” (QL:58)
	málos noun "forest" (LT2:342 – rather taurë in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	malta noun "gold", also name of tengwa #18 (Appendix E). The Etymologies (entry SMAL) instead has malda, q.v. for discussion, but according to VT46:14, the form malta originally appeared in the Etymologies as well. Also compare the root MALAT listed in PM:366.
	malwa adj. "fallow, pale" (SMAL)
	máma noun "sheep" (WJ:395)
	mámandil noun *"sheep-friend" (máma + -ndil), i.e. "shepherd"? (UT:209)
	mamil noun *"mother, mummy" (UT:191)
	man pron. "who" (Nam, RGEO:67, FS, LR:59, Markirya, MC:213, 214); cf. PM:357 note 18, where a reference is made to the Eldarin interrogative element ma, man). However, man is translated "what" in LR:59: man-ië? "what is it?" (LR:59; the stative-verb suffix -ië is hardly valid in LotR-style Quenya) Either Tolkien later adjusted the meaning of the word, or man covers both "who" and "what". Cf. also mana, manen.
	mána 1) adj. "blessed" (FS); also manna, q.v. 2) noun “any good thing or fortunate thing; a boon or ‘blessing’, a grace, being esp. used of some thing/person/event that helps or amends an evil or difficulty. (Cf. frequent ejaculation on receiving aid in trouble: yé mána (ma) = ‘what a blessing, what a good thing!)“ (VT49:41)
	mana interogative, a word translated "what is" in the sentence mana i-coimas Eldaron[?] "what is the coimas (lembas) of the Eldar?" (PM:395, a variant reading in PM:403) Either this is *ma "what" + ná "is", or mana may itself be a unitary word "what", and there is not really any word meaning "is" in the sentence. Since ma is assigned other meanings elsewhere, the latter interpretation may be the more likely.
	manaitë adj. “blessed” (VT49:41, 42)
	manaquenta adj. "blessed" (VT44:10; see manquë, manquenta)
	manar noun "doom, final end, fate, fortune" (usually = final bliss) (MANAD (under MAN), VT45:32)
	mátata, see *manta
	manca- ("k") vb. "trade" (MBAKH, VT45:33)
	mancalë ("k") noun "commerce" (MBAKH; this form apparently replaced mahtalë, cf. mahta- #2 [VT45:33])
	#manda, variant of mando (q.v.), only attested as part of the name Angamanda (q.v.)
	mandë (1) noun "doom, final end, fate, fortune" (usually = final bliss) (MANAD, under MAN)
	mandë (2) adv. “well” (VT49:26; this is “Qenya”). Rather mai in Tolkien’s later Quenya.
	mando noun "custody, safe keeping" (MR:350) or "prison, duress" (in Mandos, see below, also compare Angamando being translated 'Iron-Gaol') (SA:band). A variant #manda occurs in the place-name Angamanda (see Angamando). Personal name Mando "the Imprisoner or Binder", usually lengthened Mandos. In a deleted version of the entry MBAD of the Etymologies, Tolkien gave mando the meaning "doomsman, judge" instead of "custody" (MBAD (ÑGUR, GOS/GOTH, SPAN), VT45:33)
	Mandos (Mandost-) noun "Castle of Custody" (the approximate meaning, according to MR:350). Used as the name of a Vala, properly the place where he dwells (the Halls of Mandos), whereas his real name is Námo (WJ:402). In Tolkien’s mythology, the “Halls of Mandos” are the abode of the dead, where their spirits remain until they are released from this world (in the case of mortals) or rebodied (in the case of Elves – except for those who are refused or themselves refuse further incarnate life, and so remain in Mandos indefinitely). In the Etymologies, Mandos (also Mandossë) is interpreted somewhat differently, "Dread Imprisoner"  (MBAD (MANAD),VT45:32) or in a deleted version "Dread Doom" (VT45:33, where Mandos was asigned the stem Mandosse-). The interpretation “Dread Imprisoner” would suggest that Tolkien at the time thought of Mandos as being also properly the name of a person, the Vala Námo, not the name of a place. – See also Mando.
	mandu noun "abyss" (MC:214; this is "Qenya" - Tolkien's later Quenya has undumë)
	mandulómi noun "hell-shadows" (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	mánë noun "a spirit that has gone to the Valar or to Erumáni" (LT1:260)
	manë adj.  "good (moral)" (sc. *"good in a moral sense") (LT1:260, VT49:26)
	manen interrogative "how" (PM:395)
	manna adj. "blessed" (also mána, q.v.) (VT43:30, VT45:32, VT49:41)
	mannar inflected noun "into (the) hands", allative pl. of má, q.v. (FS)
	*manta- vb. “bless”, only attested in the present/continuative tense: mánata (VT49:39, 52, 55)
mantë pa.t. of mat-, mata-, q.v.
manquë, manquenta adj. "blessed" (VT44:10-11; it cannot be ruled out that manquë – spelt manque in the source – is simply an uncompleted form of manquenta. Whatever the case, Tolkien decided to use the form manaquenta instead, q.v.)
	manu noun "departed spirit" (MAN)
	manwa- (1) vb. "prepare" (QL:59)
	manwa (2) adj. "ready" (QL:59)
	Manwë noun "Blessed Being" (Letters:283), the Elder King and Lord of the Valar, spouse of Varda. The name is adopted and adapted from Valarin Mānawenūz; names ending in -wë were already frequent in Quenya (WJ:399). In the Etymologies derived from MAN, WEG. Cf. Mánwen, Mánwë the oldest Quenya forms of Manwë, closer to the Valarin form (WJ:399). Lower-case manwë in LR:56. Ablative Manwello, VT49:24 (in this source Tolkien indicated that lo Manwë is the preferred way of saying “from Manwë”, but this was apparently a short-lived idea; see lo). Masc. name Manwendil "Manwë-friend; one devoted to Manwë" (UT:210). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, Manwë was also the name of letter #22 (VT45:32), which tengwa Tolkien would later call vala instead – changing its Quenya value from m to v.
	manya- vb. “bless” – “sc. either to afford grace or help or to wish it” (VT49:41)
[manyel noun “female” (PE17:190)]
	mapa- vb. "grasp, seize" (MAP; according to LT2:339 this word was struck out in the "Gnomish Lexicon" [where it was quoted as the cognate of certain Gnomish words], but it reappears in the Etymologies.) Earlier material gives map- “take” (PE16:133) or map- "seize, take" with pa.t. nampë (QL:59); it is unclear if the pa.t. of map(a)- is still nampë in LotR-style Quenya.
	mapta- vb. "ravish, rape", pa.t. mapantë (PE13:163)
	maptalë noun "ravishment, rape, seizure" (PE13:163)
	maqua noun "a hand-full; complete hand with all five fingers; a closing of closed [hand] (facing down) for taking; group of five (similar) things"; in colloquial usage also "hand" as a limb (VT47:7, 18-20); dual maquat "group of ten" (VT47:7, 10). Compounded maquanotië = "decimal system" in counting (VT47:10), Lungumaqua "Heavyhand" (VT47:19)
	#maquet- vb. *"ask", only attested in the past tense: maquentë (PM:403)
	mar (1) noun "earth" (world), also "home, dwelling, mansion". Stem mard- (VT46:13, PE17:64), also seen in the ablative Mardello "from earth" (FS); the word is used with a more limited sense in oromardi “high halls” (sg. oromar, PM17:64), referring to the dwellings of Manwë and Varda on Mt. Taniquetil (Nam, RGEO:66). The initial element of Mardorunando (q.v.) may be the genitive mardo (distinguish mardo "dweller"). May be more or less identical to már "home, house, dwelling" (of persons or peoples; in names like Val(i)mar, Vinyamar, Mar-nu-Falmar, Mardil) (SA:bar, VT45:33, VT47:6). Már is however unlikely to have the stem-form mard-; a "Qenya" genitive maren appears in the phrase hon-maren, q.v., suggesting that its stem is mar-. A possible convention could therefore be to use már (mar-) for "home, house" (also when = household, family as in Mardil, q.v.), whereas mar (mard-) is used for for "earth, world". Early "Qenya" has mar (mas-) "dwelling of men, the Earth, -land" (LT1:251); notice that in LotR-style Quenya, a word in -r cannot have a stem-form in -s-.
	már (mar-) (2) noun "home, house, dwelling" (also "house" in the sense of family as in Mardil, q.v.). See mar above for references. In Mar-nu-Falmar, Mardil, and as final element in Eldamar, Fanyamar, Valimar, Vinyamar..
	mar- vb. "abide, be settled or fixed" (UT:317); maruvan "I will abide" (mar-uva-n "abide-will-I") (EO). Cf. termar-.
	Mar-nu-Falmar noun "Home under Waves", name of the sunken Númenor (Silm). See mar, már.
	mára adj. "useful, fit, good" (of things) (MAG; see MA3; Arct, VT42:34, VT45:30). Nás mara nin “I like it”, literally *“it is good to me” (VT49:30; read mára for mara?) As the comparative of mára, the unrelated adjective arya “excelling” is used in the sense of *“better”; for the superlative *“best”, one adds the article: i arya (with genitive to express “the best of…”) (PE17:57),
	maranwë noun "destiny" (MBARAT)
	marda noun “dwelling” (PE17:107)
	Mardil masc. name, "(one) devoted to the house", sc. the "house" of the kings (Appendix A; interpreted in Letters:386). This indicates that the first element can mean "house" in the sense of family or household (see mar, már). This Mardil is described as a good steward, possibly suggesting that mardil (“one devoted to the house/family”) could itself function as a common noun “(faithful) steward”.
	mardo noun "dweller" (LT1:251).
	Mardorunando noun "Redeemer of the world" (VT44:17). Unless the initial element mardo- is a distinct and otherwise unattested word for "world", it may be the genitive form of mar (mard-) "earth", q.v.
	María fem. name "Mary" (Maria; Tolkien based the Quenyarized form on the Latin pronunciation) (VT43:28; Maria with no explicit long vowel in VT44:18)
	márië (1) “goodness”, “good” as noun (abstract formation from the adj. mára). (PE17:58, 89). Genitive máriéno, dative máriena, locative máriessë (PE17:59, occurring in the greeting (hara) máriessë “(stay) in happiness”, PE17:162) Allative márienna *”to goodness”, used as an interjection “farewell” (archaic namárië, q.v.), 
	márië (2) stative verb "it is good" (FS; from mára "good"; however, the stative-verb suffix -ië is hardly valid in LotR-style Quenya)
	maril noun "glass, crystal" (VT46:13; if this is to be the same word as the second element of Silmaril, the stem-form would be marill-, cf. pl. Silmarilli)
	marilla noun "pearl" (LT1:265)
	marina adj. “ripe, mature” (QL:59)%
	mart noun "a piece of luck" (LT2:348; in LotR-style Quenya, no word can end in -rt. Read marto, as in LT2:348?)
	marta- (1) vb. "to chance" or *"happen" (QL:63), cf. mart- "it happens" (impersonal) (LT2:348 – read marta-?). Another version assigns transitive meanings to the same verb: “to define, decree, destine” (with the last sense = martya-, q.v.), with a variant umbarta- “in more lofty senses” (PE17:104)
	marta (2) adj. "fey, fated" (MBARAT) 
marta (3) noun "fate" (VT45:33, VT46:13) Cf. marto.
	Martalmar noun (place-name) (TALAM)
	martan (1) noun “dwelling-house” (stem martam-), longer variant martanan (stem martamn- as in pl. martamni) (PE17:107)
	Martan (2), also Martano, noun "Earth-smith", "Earthbuilder", a surname of Aule (TAN, GAWA/GOWO – the form Martanō given under MBAR must be understood as a primitive form). LT1:266 refers to a “very late note” where a variant Quenya form “Martamo” is derived from ¤mbartanō “world-artificer”; the stated primitive form (as well as the Sindarin cognate Barthan) would suggest that the Quenya form should be Martano; on the other hand, tamo (q.v.) does occur as a variant of tano “smith”.
	marto (1) noun “tower” (PE17:66)
	marto (2) noun "fortune, fate, lot" (LT2:348); cf. marta # 3 and see mart-.
	martya- vb. "destine" (MBARAT)
	marya adj. "pale, fallow, fawn" (MAD)
	-mas final element in placenames, equivalent to English -ton, -by  (LT1:251; hardly valid in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	#massa noun "bread" (massamma "our bread", VT43:18); massánië "breadgiver", used as a title of the highest woman among any Elvish people, since she had the keeping and gift of the coimas (lembas). Also simply translated "Lady" (PM:404)
	massë noun “bread” (as a material), variant of massa, q.v. (PE17:52). Notice that *massë has also been extrapolated as a question-word “where?” 
	masta noun “cake or loaf” (PE17:52), in an earlier source defined as "bread" (MBAS, PM:404; later sources have massa or massë for this meaning). Mastamma "our bread" in Tolkien’s translatation of the Lord’s Prayer (VT43:18). In the Etymologies, Tolkien emended the gloss of masta from "dough" to "bread" (VT45:33).
	masta- vb. "bake" (MBAS)
	masto noun "village" (LT1:251)
	mat- (1) vb. "eat" (MAT, VT45:32), also given as mata- (VT39:5), pa.t. mantë "ate" (VT39:7). The form matumnë is said to be future-past: "was going to eat", with the "OQ" (Old Quenya?) future-past element umnë (VT48:32; possibly this could function independently as a form of the verb “to be”, hence “was to be”). It is not clear if the form matumnë is itself "Old Quenya" as if this is an archaic future-past formation, or it is just umnë (as an independent word) that is archaic. (Note: Tolkien's translation of matumnë is actually "I was going to eat", but the pronoun "I" does not seem to be expressed in the Quenya form.) – Adj. or pseudo-participle #matya “eating” in melumatya “honey-eating” (PE17:68)
	mat (matt-) noun “meal, meal time” (QL:59)
	mátengwië noun "language of the hands" (VT47:9)
	mátima adj. “edible” (PE17:68), cf. mat-. 
	matl noun "food"; read *matil in LotR-style Quenya (in which language final syllabic -l becomes -il) (QL:59); however, the word matso from a later source may be preferred.
	matso noun “food” (PE16:141)
	*matil, see matl
	maur noun "dream, vision" (LT1:261)
	maurë noun "need" (MBAW)
	mausta noun "compulsion" (MBAW)
	mauya- vb. "compel" (MBAW)
mavar noun "shepherd" (LT1:268, GL:58)  
	mavoitë adj. "having hands" (LT2:339)
	maxa ("ks") adj. "pliant, soft" (MASAG, VT45:32)
	maxë ("ks") noun  "dough" (MASAG, VT45:32)
	#Máya pl. Máyar, see Maia
	¤mbelekōro masc. name,  mentioned as "the oldest Q form" of Melkor, q.v. This is obviously a form that belongs to Common Eldarin rather than Quenya as we know it: Notice that it is marked (in the source asterisked) as unattested (WJ:402). It may be that “Q” here means “Quendian” rather than Quenya.
	me (1) 1st person pl. exclusive pronoun "we, us" (VT49:51; VT43:23, VT44:9). This pronoun preserves the original stem-form (VT49:50). Stressed mé (VT49:51). Cf. also mel-lumna "us-is-heavy", sc. *"is heavy for us" (LR:47, mel- is evidently an assimilated form of men "for us", dative of me; the form men is attested by itself, VT43:21). For me as object, cf.  álamë "do not [do something to] us", negative imperative particle with object pronoun suffixed (VT43:19: álamë tulya, "do not lead us"), ámen "do [something for] us", imperative particle with dative pronoun suffixed (ámen apsenë "forgive us", VT43:12, 18). Dual exclusive met "we/us (two)" (Nam, VT49:51), "you and me" (VT47:11; the latter translation would make met an inclusive pronoun, though it is elsewhere suggested that it is rather exclusive: "him/her and me", corresponding to wet [q.v.] as the true inclusive dual form). Rá men or rámen "for us/on our behalf", see rá. Locative messë "on us", VT44:12 (also with prefix o, ó- ?"with" in the same source). See also ménë, ómë. 
	-më (2) abstract suffix, as in melmë “love” (cf. the verb mel-), #cilmë “choice” (possibly implying a verb *cil- “to choose”). According to PE17:68, primitive -mē (and -wē) were endings used to derive nouns denoting “a single action”, which may fit the meaning of cilmë (but melmë “love” would normally be something lasting rather than “a single action”). 
	mëar noun "gore" (LT1:260)
	mectar ("k") noun "Swordsman". In Telimectar ("k"). (LT1:268; in LotR-style Quenya mehtar, also macar)
	mel- vb. "love (as friend)" (MEL). Melinyes or melin sé “I love him” (VT49:21). LR:70 has melánë "I love", a doubtful form in Tolkien's later Quenya (melin occurs in later material).
méla adj. "loving, affectionate" (VT39:10), apparently compounded in mélamar, q.v. (in that word rather meaning “dear”).
mélamar noun “home”, Exilic Quenya word of emotional sense: place of one’s birth or the familiar places from which one has been separated (PE17:109). Mélamarimma noun ”Our Home”, an expression used by Exilic Noldor for Aman.
	Melcor (so spelt in MR:362 and VT49:6, 24), see Melkor
	melda adj. "beloved, dear, sweet" (MEL, VT45:34), superlative arimelda *”dearest” (PE17:56, see ar- #2), meldielto "they are beloved" (sc. meld[a]-ië-lto "beloved-are-they" – however, both the stative verb ending -ië "is/are" and the ending -lto "they" may be obsolete in LotR-style Quenya) (FS) PE17:55 gives the comparative form as arimelda or ammelda and the superlative as eremelda, anamelda or once again ammelda (PE17:55).
	#meldë noun *"friend", feminine (meldenya *"my friend" in the Elaine inscription [VT49:40], Tolkien referring to Elaine Griffiths). Compare meldo. 
meldo noun "friend, lover". (VT45:34, quoting a deleted entry in the Etymologies, but cf. the pl. #meldor in Eldameldor "Elf-lovers", WJ:412) Meldonya *”my friend” (VT49:38, 40). It may be that meldo is the distinctly masculine form, corresponding to feminine #meldë (q.v.)  
melehta adj. “mighty” (PE17:115), cf. meletya
melehtë noun “might, power” (inherent) (PE17:115)
	meles, melessë noun "love" (LT1:262; rather melmë in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	#meletya adj. "mighty", isolated from meletyalda adjective with suffix "your mighty" = "your majesty" (see -lda; meletya = *"mighty"). In full Aran Meletyalda "king your mighty" = "your majesty" (WJ:369). Compare melehta.
	melima adj. "loveable, fair" (MEL, VT45:34); Melimar a name of the Lindar (in Tolkien's former conception = the later Vanyar, not the Teleri) (MEL)
	melin adj. "dear" (MEL)
	melindo noun "lover" (m.) (MEL)
	melissë noun "lover" (f.) (MEL)
	Melko masc. name "Mighty One", name of the rebellious Vala, usually called Melkor (MIL-IK, MOR; FS – MR:350 confirms that the form Melko is still valid in Tolkien's later Quenya, though not interpreted "Greedy One" as in the Etymologies)
	Melkor (spelt Melcor in VT49:6, 24, MR:362), masc. name: the rebellious Vala, the devil of the Silmarillion mythos. Older (MET) form Melkórë "Mighty-rising" (hence the interpretation "He that arises in power"), compare órë #2. Oldest Q form *mbelekōro (WJ:402). Ablative Melkorello/Melcorello, VT49:7, 24. Compounded in Melkorohíni "Children of Melkor", Orcs ("but the wiser say: nay, the slaves of Melkor; but not his children, for Melkor had no children") (MR:416). The form Melkoro- here occurring may incorporate either the genitive ending -o or the otherwise lost final vowel of the ancient form ¤mbelekōro. For Melkor’s later name, see Moringotto / Moricotto (Morgoth) under mori-.
	melmë noun "love" (MEL)  
	#melu noun ”honey”, isolated from melumatya, q.v. (PE17:68)
	melumatya adj. “honey-eating” (PE17:68)
	melwa adj. "lovely" (LT1:262); compare melda in Tolkien’s later Quenya.
	men (1) pron. "(for) us", dative form of me, q.v.
	men (2) noun "way" (SA) or "place, spot" (MEN)
	men (3) pron. "who", evidently a misreading or miswriting for man (MC:221, in Markirya)
	#men- (4) vb. "go" (VT47:11, cf. VT42:30, VT49:23), attested in the aorist (menë) in the sentence imbi Menel Cemenyë menë Ráno tië "between Heaven and Earth goes the path of the Moon". In the verb nanwen- “return” (or go/come back), -men- is changed to -wen- following nan- “back” (etymological form cited as nan-men-, PE17:166). – In examples from VT49:23, 24, Tolkien used men- in the sense of “go as far as”: 1st person sg. aorist menin (menin coaryanna “I arrive at [or come/get to] his house”), endingless aorist menë, present tense ména- “is on point of arrival, is just coming to an end”, past tense mennë “arrived, reached”, in this tense usually with locative rather than allative (mennen sís “I arrive[d] here”), perfect eménië “has just arrived”, future menuva “will arrive”. All of these examples were first written with the verb as ten- rather than men-, Tolkien then emending the initial consonant.
	ména noun "region" (MEN). Not to be confused with the present/continuative tense of #men- “go”.
	#mendë noun "will", only attested in mendelya "thy will" (VT43:15)
	ménë pronoun in locative? "on us" (SD:310; compare me "us") The form is somewhat obscure.
Menel noun "heavens" (Markirya, SA), "the heavens, the firmament" (SD:401), "the apparent dome in the sky" (MR:387). Menel Cemenyë ("k") "Heaven and Earth" (VT47:30). Found in names like Meneldil *"Heaven-friend" = astronomer (Appendix A; Letters:386), Meneldur masc. name, *"Heaven-servant" (Appendix A, Tar-Meneldur as a Númenórean King, UT:210); menelluin *"sky-blue", used as noun = "cornflower" (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator p. 193). Menelmacar "Swordsman of the Sky", the Orion constellation (also called Telumehtar, Appendix E, first footnote); the older name was Menelmacil *"Heaven-sword" (WJ:411); Meneltarma "Pillar of Heaven", name of the great central mountain of Númenor (SA:tar, VT42:21). Menelya fifth day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the heavens (Appendix D) Locative meneldë "in heaven"; abandoned forms menellë, menelzë (VT43:12, 16). Adj. meneldëa "(being) in heaven", evidently based on a locative form meneldë "in heaven"; abandoned forms menelzëa, menellëa, menelessëa (VT43:13, VT44:16; the last of these forms would suggest the locative form #menelessë).
mennai prep. "until" (VT14:5; in Tolkien's later Quenya rather tenna)
	menta- (1) vb. "send, cause to go" (in a desired direction) (VT41:6, VT43:15). A similar-sounding primitive verb mentioned in PE17:93 is said to have past and perfect forms that would produce Quenya *mennë,  *eménië, but here Tolkien seems to be discussing a distinct intransitive verb “go” and its Sindarin descendants, and Quenya menta- rather belongs to the causative (transitive) verbs which according to the same source has “weak” past-tense forms (in -në, hence *mentanë “sent”, and likely *ementië as perfect “has sent”).
menta (2) noun "sending" or "message" as in sanwe-menta "thought-sending, mental message" (VT41:5)
	mentë noun "point, end" (MET)
	mentië noun “passage, journey, direction of travel” (PE17:13); the elements are men- “go, proceed” + tië “path, road”. Not to be confused with the gerund of menta- #1. 
	menya (pl. menyë is attested) possessive pron. "our", 1st person pl. exclusive independent possessive pronoun (VT43:19, 35). Evidently derived from the dative form men "for us" by adding the adjectival ending -ya. Compare ninya, q.v.
	mëoi noun "cat", a somewhat strange word by the standards of Tolkien's later Quenya (there are no other instances of final -oi in the singular). Some would read *mëo, if the word is to be used in LotR-style Quenya. Vardo Mëoita "Prince of Cats"; mëoita here seems to be a kind of adjective rather than a genitive (LT2:348). – Tolkien’s later, less problematic word yaulë may be preferred by writers (PE16:132)
	mer- vb. "wish, desire, want" (the form merë given in Etym seems to be the 3rd person sg. aorist, *"wishes, desires, wants"); pa.t. mernë (MER)
	[merca ("k") adj. "wild, untamed" (MERÉK, VT45:34)] Compare verca.
	meren (merend-), merendë noun "feast, festival" (MBER; Tolkien first gave the stem-form of meren as mern- before emending it to merend-, VT45:33-34)
	merya adj. "festive" (MBER)
	meryalë noun "holiday" (MBER)
	mesta noun ?"journey" (Arct)
	met dual 1st person pronoun "us (two)", including the dual ending -t (Nam, VT47:11; VT49:51, 56). See me.
	Metelairë noun alternative name of August (PM:135)
	Meterrívë noun alternative name of January (PM:135)
	métima adj. "last" (Markirya), in Markirya also twice métim', since the following words (auressë, andúnë) begin in an a.
	metta noun "end"; Ambar-metta "world-end, the end of the world" (EO); mettarë *"end-day" = New Years' Eve in the Númenórean calendar and the Steward's Reckoning, not belonging to any month (Appendix D). – The word Mettanyë, heading the final part of the poem The Trees of Kortirion, would seem to be related (LT1:43)
	metya- vb. "put an end to" (MET)
	mi prep. "in, within" (MI, VT27:20, VT44:18, 34, VT43:30; the latter source also mentions the variant imi); mí "in the" (Nam, RGEO:66; CO gives mi; the correct forms should evidently be mi = "in" and mí = mi i "in the"; VT49:35 also has mí with a long vowel, though the gloss is simply “in”). Used in PE17:71 (cf. 70) of people clad “in” various colours, e.g. mi mísë “in grey”. Allative minna "to the inside, into" (MI), also mina (VT43:30). The forms mimmë and mingwë seem to incorporate pronominal suffixes for "us", hence ?"in us", inclusive and exclusive respectively. The pronoun -mmë denoted plural inclusive "we" when this was written, though Tolkien would later make it dual instead (see -mmë). Second person forms are also given: mil or milyë *"in you" (sg.), millë "in you" (pl.) (VT43:36). A special use of mi appears in the phrase Wendë mi Wenderon "Virgin of Virgins" (VT44:18); here mi appears superfluous to achieve the desired meaning, but this combination of singular noun + mi + plural genitive noun may be seen as a fixed idiom expressing that the initial noun represents the most prominent member of a class. 
mici ("k") prep. "among" (VT43:30)
mië noun "crumb" (PE13:150), “bit, small piece” (PE16:143)

mína adj. "desiring to start, eager to go", also verb mína- "desire to go in some direction, to wish to go to a place, make for it, have some end in view" (VT39:11)
	Minalcar masc. name, noun *"First-glory"??? (Appendix A)
	Minardil masc.name noun *"minar[?]-friend". Perhaps minar is to be understood as a variant of minas (s being voiced to z by contact with the voiced plosive that follows, and then regularly becoming r); if so, the name means *"Tower-friend" (Appendix A)
minassë noun  "fort, city, with a citadel and central watch-tower" (VT42:24)
	Minastan masc.name, noun *"Tower-maker" (Appendix A)
	Minastir masc. name, noun *"Tower-watcher" (Appendix A)
minasurie noun "enquiry" (Þ; the word is actually cited as minaþurie) in Ondonóre Nómesseron Minaþurie "Enquiry into the Place-names of Gondor". The editor tentatively analyzes minaþurie as #mina "into" + #þurie (#surië) noun "seeking" (VT42:17, 30-31).
	minda adj. "prominent, conspicuous" (MINI)
mindë noun "turret" (VT42:24)
[Mindi noun ”First-clan” (PE17:155)]
	mindo noun "isolated tower" (MINI)
	Mindolluin noun *"Blue Tower" (mindon + luin), name of a mountain. (Christopher Tolkien translates the name as "Towering Blue-head" in the Silmarillion Index, but this seems to be based on the questionable assumption that it includes the Sindarin element dol "head, hill". Unless this translation is given in his father's papers, the name is better explained as a Quenya compound.)
	mindon noun "(great, lofty) tower", said to be an augmented form of mindë (VT42:24). Allative pl. mindoninnar in Markirya, changed to the contracted form mindonnar. Cf. also Mindon Eldaliéva "Lofty Tower of the Eldalië" (Silm)
	minë numeral "one", also min (MINI, VT45:34)
	minga-ránar compound noun in pre-classical locative "in waning-moon" (locative -r) (MC:213; this is "Qenya") 
	minna prep. "to the inside, into" (also mir) (MI); variant mina "into" (VT43:30), possibly occurring, compounded, in minasurie, q.v.
	Minnónar pl. noun "First-born", Elves (as contrasted to Apanónar, the After-born, Men). Sg. #Minnóna  (WJ:403)
	minquë ("q") cardinal "eleven" (MINIK-W, LT1:260, VT48:4, 6, 8, VT49:57). Not to be confused with minquë as the pa.t. of miqu- "to kiss", q.v. Etymology discussed, VT48:7, 8 (where the unorthodox spelling "minkwe" occurs besides "minque").
	minquesta fraction "one eleventh" (1/11). (VT48:11)
	minta prep. "inwards, [?into]" (Tolkien's gloss is not certainly legible). Also mitta. (VT45:34)
	mintë adj. "small" (VT45:35)
	mintya ??? (Narqelion)
	minya adj. "first" (MINI) (cf. Minyatur, Minyon); "eminent, prominent" (VT42:24, 25). Minyar "Firsts", the original name of the Vanyar (or rather the direct Quenya descendant of the original Primitive Quendian name) (WJ:380)
	Minyarussa noun "First-russa", masc. name (VT41:10)
	Minyatur noun "First-ruler"; Tar-Minyatur "High First-ruler", title of Elros as the first King of Númenor (SA:minas, PM:348, SA:tur)
	Minyon noun "First-begotten", attested as a personal (masc.) name (MR:87). Apparently this is minya "first" + the stem ON = beget.
	miqu- vb. "to kiss", the pa.t. minquë ("q") is cited, not to be confused with the cardinal minquë "eleven" (QL:61). Also miquë ("q") noun "a kiss". Old plural form miquilis ("q") "kisses" (MC:215; this is "Qenya") 
	miquelis (miquelis(s)-) noun “soft, sweet kiss” (PE16:96)
	mir (1) prep. with old allative ending "to the inside, into" (also minna) (MI). This is mi "in" with the same allative ending -r (from primitive ¤-da) as in tar "thither", q.v.
	mir (2) cardinal "one" (LT1:260; in LotR-style Quenya rather minë)
	mírë noun "jewel" (MIR, SA:mîr), “a treasure, a precious thing” (PE17:37). Cf. Elemmírë; short form -mir in Tar-Atanamir (SA:mîr); see also Artamir. 
	Míriel noun *"Jewel-woman" or *“Jewel-daughter” (Silm), genitive Míriello (see namna) indicating a stem-form #Míriell-.
	miril (mirill-, as in pl. mirilli) noun "shining jewel" (MBIRIL)
	mirilya- vb. "glitter" (MBIRIL)
	mírima adj. “very valuable” (PE17:37)
	mirima adj. "free" (MIS). (“Free” is rather expressed as léra in Tolkien’s later Quenya; mirima would be prone to confusion with mírima above.)
	Mirimor noun *"the Free", a name of the Teleri; sg. #Mirimo (MIS)
	mirroanwi "incarnates, those (spirits) 'put into flesh' "; sg. *mirroanwë (MR:350, VT48:34)
miruvor, full form miruvórë noun "mead", "a special wine or cordial"; possessive miruvóreva "of mead" (Nam, RGEO:66; WJ:399). In the "Qenya Lexicon", miruvórë was defined "nectar, drink of the Valar" (LT1:261).
mirwa adj. “precious, valuable” (PE17:37)
mírya adj. “beautiful” (of work of art only) (PE17:165)
mis adverbial particle "less" (PE14:80)
mísë (þ, cf. Sindarin mith-) adj. “grey” (used as noun of grey clothes in the phrase mi mísë of someone clad “in grey”). The underlying stem refers a paler or whiter “grey” than sinda, making mísë “a luminous grey” (PE17:71-72)
misil (changed by Tolkien from misilya) noun *"silver (jewel-like) brilliance" (VT27:20, 27; this is "Qenya", but cf. mísë.)

	mistë noun "fine rain" (MIZD, VT45:35)
	mitra, see mitsa
	mitsa adj. "small" (VT45:35) Another synonym from the same source, mitra, looks unusual for a Quenya word (because of the medial cluster tr)
	mitta- (1) vb. "insert" (VT43:30)
	mitta- (2) prep. "between" (VT43:30; the final hyphen may suggest that suffixes would normally follow)
	mitta (3) noun "piece" (VT45:81)
	mitta (4) prep. "inwards, [?into]" (Tolkien’s gloss is not certainly legible). Also minta. (VT45:34)
	Mittalmar noun the "Midlands" of Númenor (UT:165). May incorporate mitta- "between" and hence *"in the middle".
	mittanya- vb. "to lead" (+ allative: lead into) (VT43:10, 22; Tolkien may have abandoned this form in favour of tulya-)
	mitya adj. "interior" (MI)
	miulë noun  "whining, mewing" (MIW)
	mixa ("ks") adj. "wet" (MISK); later sources have néna, nenya
	-mma “our”, 1st person dual exlusive possessive ending: *“my and one other’s” (VT49:16). At an earlier conceptual phase, Tolkien apparently intended the same ending to be plural inclusive “our” (VT49:55, RS:324), cf. Mélamarimma “Our Home” (q.v.) In the latter word, Tolkien slips in i as a connecting vowel before this ending; elsewhere he used e, as in Átaremma “our Father” (see atar).
	-mmë “we”, 1st person dual exclusive pronominal ending: *“I and one other” (compare the inclusive dual form -ngwë or -nquë). First written -immë in one source (VT49:57). Carimmë, *“the two of us do” (VT49:16, cf. VT43:6). At an earlier conceptual stage, the ending was already exclusive, but plural rather than dual: vammë "we won't" (WJ:371), firuvammë "we will die" (VT43:34), etemmë ?"out of us" (VT43:36); see also VT49:48, 49, 55. Also compare the corresponding emphatic pronoun emmë (q.v.). The ending -lmë replaced -mmë in its former (plural exclusive) sense. In some early material, -mmë was apparently used as an ending for plural inclusive “we” (VT49:55).
	[-mmo “we (two)”, abandoned pronominal suffix for the 1st person dual exclusive, which ending Tolkien later revised to -mmë (VT49:48).]
mo, indefinite pronoun "one, someone, anyone" (VT42:34, VT49:19, 20, 26)
	-mo ending frequent in names and titles, sometimes with an agental significance (WJ:400)
	moalin (moalind-) noun “sheepfold” (QL:60)
	moc- ("k") vb.  "hate" (given as mocir ["k"] "I hate" in LT1:258; read *mocin if the word is to be adapted to Tolkien's later Quenya)
	moia- vb. "labour, be afflicted" (VT43:31)
moica ("k") adj. "gentle, soft" (GL:58)
	moilë noun "tarn" (LT2:349)
	moina (1) adj. "familiar, dear" (MOY (MUY) )
moina (2) adj. "safe, secure" (GL:58; this "Qenya" word is evidently obsoleted by # 1 above. This second moina seems to reappear as muina "hidden, secret" in Tolkien's later Quenya.)
	mól noun "slave, thrall" (MŌ, VT43:31)
	mol- vb. “labour” (a form mólë also listed is presumably the pa.t. – though it could also be “labour” as a noun) (PE17:115)
	#móla adj. *“of slave(s), slavish”, isolated from mólanoldorin
	mólanoldorin noun "the language of the Noldor enslaved by Morgoth" (MŌ) (Changed by Tolkien from múlanoldorin.)
	#móna noun "womb" (isolated from mónalyo "of thy womb") (VT43:31)
	mor noun "darkness" (Letters:308; probably just an Elvish "element" rather than a complete word; Namárië has mornië for "darkness")
	morco ("k") noun "bear" (MORÓK)
	mordo (1) noun "shadow, obscurity, stain" (MOR)
	mordo (2) noun "warrior, hero" (LT1:268 - probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
	morë adj. "black" (MOR), "dark, darkness" (Letters:282). In compounds the stem-form mori- (q.v.) appears, since the primitive form was ¤mori.
	mórë noun "blackness, dark, night, darkness" (MOR, MC:214), also given with a short vowel: morë "dark, darkness" (Letters:282). If this is the initial element of Morinehtar "Darkness-slayer" (PM:384, 385), it would seem to have the stem-form mori-, though mori- is normally the adjective "dark, black" (see below).
mori- "dark, black" in a number of compounds (independent form morë, q.v.): Morimando "Dark Mando" = Mandos (MBAD, VT45:33), morimaitë "black-handed" (LotR3:VI ch. 6, VT49:42). Moriquendi "Dark Elves" (SA:mor, WJ:361, 373), Moringotto "Black Foe", Sindarin Morgoth, later name of Melkor. The oldest form is said to have been Moriñgotho (MR:194). In late material, Tolkien is seen to consider both Moringotto and Moricotto (“k”) as the Quenya form of the name Morgoth (VT49:24-25; Moricotto also appears in the ablative, Moricottollo). Morion "the dark one", a title of Morgoth (FS). Morifinwë "dark Finwë", masc. name; he was called Caranthir in Sindarin (short Quenya name Moryo). (PM:353) In the name Morinehtar, translated "Darkness-slayer", the initial element is defined would thus seem to signify "darkness" rather than "dark" as an adjective (see mórë). (PM:384, 385)
	móri adj. "dark" (MC:221; this is "Qenya"; in Tolkien's later Quenya mórë, morë)
	mori noun "night" (LT1:261, in Tolkien's later Quenya mórë, morë)
	morilindë noun "nightingale" (MOR)
	morion noun "son of the dark" (LT1:261). In Fíriel's Song, Morion is translated "dark one", referring to Melko(r); this may be a distinct formation not including the patronymic ending -ion "son", but rather the masculine ending -on added to the adjective morë, mori- "dark".
	Mormacil ("k") noun "Black-sword" (name of Túrin, Sindarin Mormegil) (MAK)
morna adj. "dark, black" (Letters:282, LT1:261; also used of black hair, PE17:154), or "gloomy, sombre" (MOR). Used as noun in the phrase mi…morna of someone clad “in…black” (PE17:71). In tumbalemorna (Letters:282), q.v. Pl. mornë in Markirya (the first version of this poem had "green rocks", MC:215, changed to ondolisse mornë "upon dark rocks" in the final version; see MC:220, note 8).
	mornië noun "darkness" (Nam, RGEO:67), “dark, blackness” (PE17:73). Early "Qenya" also has Mornië "Black Grief", "the black ship that plies between Mandos and Erumáni" (LT1:261). This is probably a compound of mor- "black" and nië "tear".
	móro noun “ink” (PE16:133)
	morqua adj. "black" (LT1:261; rather morna in LotR-style Quenya)
	moru- vb. "to hide" (LT1:261)
	Moryo see Morifinwë under mori-
	móta- noun "labour, toil" (MŌ)
	motto noun "blot" (MBOTH)
	muilë noun "secrecy" (MUY)
	muina adj. "hidden, secret" (MUY)
	[múlanoldorin] noun "the language of the Noldor enslaved by Morgoth" (MŌ) (Changed by Tolkien to mólanoldorin.)
	mul- vb. “grind”, pa.t. múle (QL:63)
	mulë noun ”meal, grist” (PE17:115, 181), replacing polë, q.v.
	mulma noun “fine flour” (QL:63). Compare mulë from a post-LotR source.
	mundo (1) noun "bull" (Letters:422)
	mundo (2) noun "snout, nose, cape" (MBUD)
	munta pron. "nothing" (PE14:81)
	murmë noun "slumber" (LT1:261)
	murmëa adj. "slumbrous" (LT1:261)
	muru- vb. "to slumber" (LT1:261)
	mussë adj. "soft" (VT:39:17), also used as a noun (perhaps primarily in the pl. form mussi) with the same meaning as mussë tengwi, see below. (VT39:17)
#mussë tengwë noun-phrase only attested in the pl.: mussë tengwi ("ñ") "soft elements", a term for vowels, semi-vowels (y, w)  and continuants (l, r, m, n). (In the pl. we would rather expect *mussi tengwi with the pl. form of the adjective.) (VT39:17)

<N>
-n (1) dative ending, originating as a reduced form of -nă “to”, related to the allative ending -nna (VT49:14). Attested in nin, men, ten, enyalien, Erun, airefëan, tárin, yondon (q.v.) and also added to the English name Elaine (Elainen) in a book dedication to Elaine Griffiths (VT49:40). The longer dative ending -na is also attested in connection with some pronouns, such as sena, téna, véna (q.v.), also in the noun mariéna from márië “goodness” (PE17:59). Pl. -in (as in hínin, see hína), partitive pl. -lin, dual -nt (Plotz). The preposition ana (#1) is said to be used “when purely dative formula is required” (PE17:147), perhaps meaning that it can replace the dative ending, e.g. *ana Eru instead of Erun for “to God”.  – In some of Tolkien’s earlier material, the ending -n (or -en) expressed genitive rather than dative, but he later decided that the genitive ending was to be -o (cf. such a revision as Yénië Valinóren becoming Yénië Valinórëo, MR:200).
	-n (2), also -nyë, pronominal ending, 1st person sg. "I" (VT49:51), as in utúlien "I am come" (EO), cainen “I lay” (VT48:12-13), carin or carinyë “I do” (VT49:16), veryanen *”I married” (VT49:45). See also VT49:48. Long form -nye- with object ending -s “it” following in utúvienyes (see tuv-). A possible attestation of -n in object position (“me”) is provided by the untranslated verbal form tankassen (PE17:76), where -n may be preceded by -sse- as a longer form of the 3rd person sg. ending -s (see -s #1).
	-n (3) a plural sign used in some of the case endings (WJ:407): Pl. genitive -on, pl. ablative -llon (but also -llor), pl. locative -ssen.
	n-alalmino ??? (twice in Narqelion; perhaps ne + alalmino)
ná (1) vb. "is" (am). (Nam, RGEO:67). This is the copula used to join adjectives, nouns or pronouns “in statements (or wishes) asserting (or desiring) a thing to have certain quality, or to be the same as another” (VT49:28). Also in impersonal constructions: ringa ná “it is cold” (VT49:23). The copula may however be omitted “where the meaning is clear” without it (VT49:9). Ná is also used as an interjection “yes” or “it is so” (VT49:28). Short na in airë [] na, "[] is holy" (VT43:14; some subject can evidently be inserted in the place of [].) Short na also functions as imperative: alcar mi tarmenel na Erun "glory in high heaven be to God" (VT44:32/34), also na airë "be holy" (VT43:14); also cf. nai “be it that” (see nai #1). The imperative participle á may be prefixed (á na, PE17:58). However, VT49:28 cites ná as the imperative form. Pl. nar or nár “are" (PE15:36, VT49:27, 9, 30); dual nát (VT49:30). With pronominal endings: nányë/nanyë “I am”, nalyë or natyë “you (sg.) are” (polite and familiar, respectively), nás “it is”, násë “(s)he is”, nalmë “we are” (VT49:27, 30). Some forms listed in VT49:27 are perhaps to be taken as representing the aorist: nain, naityë, nailyë (1st person sg, and 2nd person familiar/polite, respectively); does a following na represent the aorist with no pronominal ending? However, the forms nanyë, nalyë, ná, nassë, nalme, nar (changed from nár) are elsewhere said to be “aorist”, without the extra vowel i (e.g. nalyë rather than nailyë); also notice that *“(s)he is” is here nassë rather than násë (VT49:30). Pa.t. nánë or né “was”, pl. náner/nér and dual nét “were” (VT49:6, 9, 10, 27, 28, 30, 36). According to VT49:31, né “was” cannot receive pronominal endings (though nésë “he was” is attested elsewhere, VT49:28-29), and such endings are rather added to the form ane-, e.g. anen “I was”, anel “you were”, anes “(s)he/it was” (VT49:28-29). Future tense nauva "will be" (VT42:34, VT49:19, 27; another version however gives the future tense as uva, VT49:30). Nauva with a pronominal ending occurs in tanomë nauvan “I will be there” (VT49:19), this example indicating that forms of the verb ná may also be used to indicate position. Perfect anaië “has been” (VT49:27, first written as anáyë). Infinitive (or gerund) návë “being”, PE17:68. See also nai #1.
	ná (2), also nán, conj. "but, on the contrary, on the other hand" (NDAN; the form nan, q.v., is probably to be preferred to avoid confusion with ná "is", *nán "I am").
	na (1) form of the verb "to be", evidently the imperative (or subjunctive): Tolkien stated that na airë would mean "be holy" (VT43:14), and san na (q.v.) must mean "thus be" = "let it be so"; see ná #1 Cf. also the sentence alcar mi tarmenel na Erun "glory in high heaven be to God" (VT44:32/34). Inserted in front of a verb, na expresses a wish: aranielya na tuluva "may thy kingdom come" (ibid).
	na (2) prep. "to, towards", possibly obsoleted by #1 above; for clarity writers may use the synonym ana instead (NĀ1). Originally, Tolkien glossed na as "at, by, near"; the new meaning entered together with the synonyms an, ana (VT45:36).
	[na-] (3) a prefix occurring in the Markirya poem, changed by Tolkien to a-, q.v.
	-na (4), ending used to form passive participles as well as some adjectives and nouns; see -ina. According to PE17:68, the ending -na was “no longer part of verbal conjugation”; the derived words are thus considered independent adjectives (sometimes nouns) rather than regularly derived passive participles, the obvious etymological connection to certain verbal stems notwithstanding. Where adding the ending to a root would produce the combinations tn, pn, kn (cn), metathesis occurs to produce nt, (np >) mp, nc, as in nanca *”slain” for older ¤ndakna, or hampa “restrained, delayed, kept” vs. the root KHAP “retain, keep, detain”. Following -l, the suffix -na turns into -da, as in yulda “draught, the amount drunk” for older yulna (this being an example of a noun being derived with this ending, though Tolkien might also explain yulda as containing a distinct ending -da [q.v.] denoting the result of a verbal action). The word *turúna “mastered” (q.v., only attested in elided form turún’) would seem to be a passive participle formed from the verb turu- “master” (PE17:113), suggesting that in the case of U-stem verbs, their final -u is lengthened to ú when -na is added.
	#nac- ("k") vb. “hew, cut” (nacin “I hew, cut”, VT49:24) or "bite" (NAK); compare nahta #2.
	nácë (“k”) interjection? “it is may be seeming” (sic) (VT49:28) Patrick Wynne believes the unclear gloss is “best understood as elliptical”: i.e. as representing “it is [or] may be seeming”, probably “indicating a qualified or hesitant ‘yes’.” (VT49:29) As first written, the gloss was “not as it is [or may be seeming” (ibid.) 
	náha adj. “narrow” (PE17:166)
	naham- vb. "to summon", passive participle nahamna "summoned" (also in LR:47). Tolkien tentatively considered the alternative forms nahom- with pp. nahomna or natyam- with pp. natyamna; as the passive participle he also considered the form nahemna (cf. nahémë under nahámë below) (VT45:21)
	nahámë noun  "summons". Tolkien tentatively considered the alternative forms natyámë or nahémë (VT45:21)
	Nahar noun the name of Oromë's horse, adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:401)
	nahemna, see naham-
	nahom-, nahomna, see naham-
	nahta- (1) verb “slay” (nahtan “I slay”). Possible variant #nehta- see #nehtar. Passive participle nahtana in the phrase nahtana ló Túrin *”slain by Turin”. (VT49:24)
	nahta (2) noun "a bite" (NAK)
nahta (3) cardinal "eighteen" (PE14:17)
	nai (1) imperative verb "be it that", used with a verb (usually in the future tense) to express a wish. The translation "maybe" in Tolkien's rendering of Namárië is somewhat misleading; he used "be it that" in the interlinear translation in RGEO:67. Apparently this is na as the imperative "be!" with a suffix -i "that", cf. i #3. It can be used with the future tense as an “expression of wish” (VT49:39). Nai hiruvalyë Valimar! Nai elyë hiruva! *"May thou find Valimar. May even thou find it!" (Nam, VT49:39). Nai tiruvantes "be it that they will guard it" > "may they guard it" (CO). Nai elen siluva parma-restalyanna *“may a star shine upon your book-fair” (VT49:38), nai elen siluva lyenna *”may a star shine upon you” (VT49:40), nai elen atta siluvat aurenna veryanwesto *”may two stars shine upon the day of your wedding” (VT49:42-45), nai laurë lantuva parmastanna lúmissen tengwiesto “may (a) golden light fall on your book at the times of your reading” (VT49:47). Nai may also be used with a present continuative verb if an ongoing situation is wished for: Nai Eru lye mánata “God bless you” (VT49:39) or literally *”be it that God is (already) blessing you”. The phrase nai amanya onnalya *”be it that your child [will be] blessed” omits any copula; Tolkien noted that “imper[ative] of wishes precedes adj.” (VT49:41). VT49:28 has the form nái for “let it be that”; Patrick Wynne theorizes that nái is actually an etymological form underlying nai (VT49:36)
	nai (2) prefix “ill, grievously, abominably” (PE17:151), cf. naiquet-. Earlier material also lists an  interjection nai "alas" (NAY; this may be obsoleted by # 1 above; Namárië uses ai! in a similar sense)
	naica (1) adj. “bitterly painful or grievous” (PE17:151)
naica (2) noun "dagger" (GL:37)
#naicando (and #naico, both attested as plural forms in -or) noun "sinner" (VT43:33; Tolkien may have abandoned these forms i favour of #úcarindo)    
	naicë ("k") noun "sharp pain" (NÁYAK); changed by Tolkien from naiquë ("q") (VT45:37)
	naicelë ("k") noun, apparently "sharp pain" (NÁYAK); changed by Tolkien from naiquelë ("q") (VT45:37)
	naicelëa ("k") adj. "painful" (NÁYAK); changed by Tolkien from naiquelëa ("q") (VT45:37)
	naico (1) noun "sinner"; see naicando
	naico (2) ("k") inflected noun? "of hill(s)" (???) (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	naina- vb. "lament" (NAY), also reduplicated nainaina- (VT45:37). Gerund nainië, "lament" as a noun (RGEO:66)
	nainaina-, see naina-
	[naiquë, naiquelë, naiquelëa] ("q"), see naicë, naicelë, naicelëa
	naiquet- vb. “to curse or blaspheme” (PE17:151)
	Naira (1) noun "Heart of Flame", a name of the Sun (MR:198)
	naira (2) adj. “vast, wide, empty” (PE17:27)
	naira (3) adj. “dreadful, horrible, unendurable” (PE17:151)
	nairë noun "lament" (NAY)
	naitë adj. “true” (VT49:28)
	naitya- vb. "put to shame, abuse" (the latter gloss presumably referring to verbal abuse) (QL:65)
	nal, nallë noun "dale, dell" (LT1:261)
	nalda adj. "valley" (used as an adjective), also “lowly” (LT1:261, QL:66)$
	nalla ??? (Narqelion)
	nalláma, nallama noun "echo" (LAM). The initial element may be nan- “back”, hence “back-sound”, sound that comes back (cf. láma).
	nalmë (1) “we are”, see ná #1, -lmë
	[nalmë] (2) ("ñ") noun "clamour" (ÑGAL/ÑGALAM)
	nalta ("ñ") noun "radiance, glittering reflection" (from jewels, glass or polished metals, or water) (PM:347)
	Ñaltariel noun true Quenya form of Galadriel; the form actually used was Altariel, Quenyarized from Telerin Alatáriel(lë). (PM:347)
	nalyë, vb. “you are”, “thou art”; see ná #1 
	#nam- vb. "judge", attested in the 1st person aorist: namin "I judge" (VT41:13). Compare Námo.
	náma noun "a judgement" or "a desire" (VT41:13)
	námië noun "(a single) judgement", "(a single) desire" (VT41:13)
	namárië interjection "farewell" (Nam, RGEO:67)
	namba noun "a hammer" (NDAM), namba- vb. "to hammer" (NDAM). According to VT45:37, Tolkien may have considered the alternative form lamba, but the source is obscure and lamba is assigned a quite different meaning ("tongue") elsewhere.
	Nambarauto noun "hammerer of copper [> metal]", masc. name (S Damrod) (RAUTĀ)
	namma noun "claw, talon" (also nappa) (VT47:20)
	namna noun "statute"; Namna Finwë Míriello "the Statute of Finwë and Míriel" (MR:258)
	Námo (1) noun "Judge", name of a Vala, normally called Mandos, properly the place where he dwells (WJ:402)
	námo (2) noun "a person, somebody" (PM:340 – writers may prefer the synonym quén to avoid confusion with # 1)
	nampë pa.t. of map(a)-, q.v.
	nan conj. "but" (FS); the Etymologies also gives ná, nán (NDAN), but these words may be confused with forms of the verb "to be", so nan should perhaps be preferred, unless for "but" one uses the wholly distinct word mal. In Tolkien's later Quenya, it may be that he introduced new words for “but” to free up nan for another meaning (perhaps the adverb “back”, compare the prefix nan-). 
	nan (nand-) noun "woodland" (LT1:261)
	nan- (prefix) "backwards" (NDAN) or “back”, as in nanwen- “return” (go/come back, PE17:166), cf. also nanquernë *”turned back”, the pl. form of *nanquerna (VT49:17-18). Apparently assimilated nal- in nalláma “echo” (if this represents *nan-láma “back-sound”, sound coming back). 
	Nanar pl. noun "Green-elves, *Danians", sg. *Nana (DAN)
	nanda noun “vale (wide)” (PE17:80), "water-mead, watered plain" (NAD)
	nanca adj. *”slain” (PE17:68); see -na
	#nancar- vb. “undo” (destroy). Cited in the form nancari- (“k”), apparently including the connecting vowel of the aorist (PE17:166)
	nanda- ("ñ") vb. "to harp" (ÑGAN/ÑGÁNAD)
	nandaro ("ñ") noun "harper" (ÑGAN/ÑGÁNAD)
	nandë (1) noun "valley" in Laurenandë (UT:253), elided nand’ in the name Nand’ Ondoluncava (k”) “Stonewain Valley” (PE17:28). Possibly the complete word is here meant to be the variant nando (PE17:80), as suggested by the alternative form Ondoluncanan(do) (“k”) “Stonewain Valley”. Also nan, nand- noun "valley" (Letters:308); Nan-Tasarion "Vale of Willows" (LotR2:III ch. 4) (Note that this and the next nandë would be spelt differently in Tengwar writing, and originally they were also pronounced differently, since nandë "harp" was ñandë in First Age Quenya.) 
	nandë (2) ("ñ") noun "harp" (ÑGAN/ÑGÁNAD; according to VT46:3, Tolkien changed the final vowel from -a to -ë)
	nandelë ("ñ") noun "harping" (ÑGAN/ÑGÁNAD)
	nandellë ("ñ") noun "little harp" (ÑGAN/ÑGÁNAD)
	nandin noun "fay of the country" (LT1:261)
	#Nando (1) pl. Nandor noun name of the Green-elves (Laiquendi). The primitive word ¤ndandō, whence Quenya Nando, implied "one who goes back on his word or decision", since the Nandor left the March from Cuiviénen to Aman. Adj. Nandorin. (WJ:412, VT48:32)
	nando (2) “valley, wide valley”, variant of nandë #1, q.v. (PE17:80)
	nánë vb. “was”, náner “were”; see ná #1
	nangwa noun "jaw" (NAK)
	nanwa adj. “existing, actual (true)” (VT49:30). Compare the near-synonym anwa.
	nanwë noun "ebb, lowtide" (VT48:26). Compare lanwë.
	nanwen- vb. “return” (go/come back) (PE17:166). The etymological form nan-men- indicates that the second element is #men- “go”, changed to -wen- following nan- “back”; hence the perfect should perhaps be *naneménië.
	nányë vb. “I am”; see ná #1
	napan- vb. “add” (PE17:146)
nápat noun "thumb and index as a pair", a dual formation. Apparently formed from #nápa, an alternative form of nápo "thumb"; Telerin also has a final -a (rather than -o) in this word (VT48:5; etymology, VT48:16)
	nápo noun "thumb" (VT47:10, VT48:4, 5). Compare nápat.
	nappa noun "claw, talon" (also namma) (VT47:20)
	napsa noun “suspicion” (QL:64)
	nar (1) "are"; see ná #1
	[nar] (2), see [narwë]
	nár noun "flame", also nárë (NAR1). Translated "fire" in some names, see Aicanár(o), Fëanáro (where nár apparently has the masculine ending -o added to it). According to PE17:183, nár- is “fire as an element” (a concrete fire or blaze is rather called a ruinë). 
	naraca ("k") adj. "harsh, rending, violent" (NÁRAK; according to VT45:37, Tolkien added a qualification that is not certainly legible: "of [?sounds]")
	narca- ("k") vb. "to rend" (NÁRAK; the form "narki" in LR is a misreading for narka; see VT45:37)
	narda noun "knot" (SNAR)
	nárë, also short nár, noun "flame" (NAR1, Narqelion). Translated "fire" in some names, see Aicanáro, Fëanáro (where nár apparently has the masculine ending -o, though in the latter name it may also be the genitive ending since Fëa-náro is translated “Spirit of Fire”). At one point, Tolkien mentioned “nār-“ as the word for “fire (as an element)” (PE17:183). Cf. ruinë as the word for “a fire” (a concrete instance of fire) in the same source.
	Nárië noun sixth month of the year, "June" (Appendix D); derived from the stem (a)nar- having to do with fire or sun.
	Narmacil noun masc. name, *"Flame-sword" (Appendix A)
	narmo  ("ñ") noun "wolf" (ÑGAR(A)M; both the old form ñarmo = *ngarmo and the Third Age form narmo are given). Another word for “wolf” is ráca.
	Narquelië noun tenth month of the year, "October" (Appendix D); the word seems to mean "Fire-waning", "Sun-waning". Compare narquelion ("q"), q.v.
	Narquelion ("q") noun "fire-fading, autumn" (FS, Narqelion, KWEL, (LAS1), "nar-qelion", VT45:24); simply translated "Fading" in LR:72. The word also heads a section of the poem The Trees of Kortirion (LT1:41).
	Narsil (Þ) noun the sword of Elendil, compound of the stems seen in Anar "Sun" and Isil "Moon"; see Letters:425 for etymology
	Narsilion (Þ) noun "(the song) of the Sun and Moon"; actually the stems of the words for Sun and Moon compounded (see Narsil above) and a plural genitive ending added (Silm)
	narta- vb. "kindle" (VT45:37)
	Narvinyë noun first month of the year, "January". The word seems to mean "New Fire/Sun". (Appendix D)
	*narwa adj. “ruddy, red of hair” (PE17:154), also "fiery red" in general (NAR1; only the archaic form narwā is given in the Etymologies)
	[narwë (and short nar, unless this is an incomplete form) noun "sign, token"] (VT45:37)
	Narya noun or adj. name of the Red Ring, the Ring of Fire; apparently properly an adjective, so that the meaning is something like "Fiery (One)" (SA:nár)
	násan, see násië
	nasar adj. "red" (in Vanyarin Quenya only). Adopted and adapted from Valarin. (WJ:399)
	násë “he is” (also nassë) (VT49:30); see ná #1.
	násië interjection "amen", "may it be so" (VT43:24, 35. As a translation of "amen", Tolkien apparently abandoned the earlier form násan and the two-word variant san na, VT43:24)
	nassë (1) “a person, an individual” (VT49:30). Also translated “true-being” (pl. nasser is attested), the inner “true” being of a person. With a pronominal suffix in the form nassentar “their true-being” (PE17:175, cf. -nta #2), in the source referring to the “true” spiritual nature of the Valar, as hidden within their visible shapes. The word nassentar would seem to be plural, *“their true-beings”. – Not to be confused with the verb nassë/násë “he/she is”; see ná #1. 
	nassë (2) noun "thorn, spike" (NAS). Not to be confused with nassë “(s)he is”, VT49:30 or nassë #1 above. Note that in late material, the unambiguous word necel appears for “thorn” (PE17:55).
	nasta (1) noun "spear-head, spear-point, gore, triangle" (SNAS/SNAT; see VT46:14 about second gloss being "spear-point" and not simply "point" as in the printed Etymologies), "prick, point, stick, thrust" (NAS)
	nasta- (2) vb. "prick, sting" (NAS)
	nat noun "thing" (NĀ2); compare únat. VT49:30 lists “năta, nat”, but it is unclear whether năta is here a Quenya word or an etymological form underlying Quenya nat. 
	náto interjection “it is that” (emphatic word for “yes”?) (VT49:28, 29)
	natsë noun "web, net" (NAT)
	nattira- vb. "despise" (or perhaps the stem proper should only be #nattir-) (VT44:8)
	[nattirë vb. “look back” (PE17:166)]
	natyam-, natyamna, see naham-
	natyámë, see nahámë
	natyë vb. “you are”, “thou art”; see ná #1
	nauca ("k") adj. "stunted" (VT39:7), “stunted, shortened, dwarf(ed)” (PE17:45), especially applied to things that though in themselves full-grown were smaller or shorter than their kind, and were hard, twisted or ill-shapen (WJ:413). The word can also be used as a noun “dwarf” (PE17:45), the meaning it also had in Tolkien’s early "Qenya" (LT1:261), but the distinct noun-form Nauco may be more usual.
	Nauco ("k") noun "Dwarf" (capitalized in WJ:388, but not in Etym, stem NAUK). Naucalië (not *Naucolië) the "Dwarf-people" as a whole. Nauco is a personalized form of the adjective nauca “stunted” (itself sometimes used as a  noun “dwarf”); pl. naucor (PE17:45). See also Picinaucor.
	Naucon (Naucond-, as in the pl. Naucondi) noun “dwarf”, variant of Nauco (PE17:45; not capitalized in the source)
	naulë noun "wolf-howl" (ÑGAW; this must represent earlier *ñaulë = *ngaulë; these forms are not given in Etym, but compare ñauro below. In Tengwar writing, the initial N would be represented by the letter noldo, not númen.)
	nauro  ("ñ") noun "werewolf" (ÑGAW, PE17:39; according to the latter source, the word was adapted from Sindarin gaur). 
	nausë (Þ) noun "imagination" (NOWO, VT49:33)
	nauta adj. "bound, obliged" (NUT)
nauva vb. "will be" (VT42:34); nauvan “I will be” (VT49:19); see ná #1
#nav- vb. "judge" (cited in the form navë, apparently the 3rd person aorist). Also given with pronominal suffixes: navin *"I judge" (Tolkien's free translation: "I think"), navilwë "we judge" (VT42:33, 4, VT48:11)
	náva ("ñ") noun "mouth", apparently not only the lips but also the inside of the mouth (VT39:13 cf. 8). Possibly, but probably not, the same element that is translated "hollow" in Návarot, q.v.
	návë “being”, *”to be”, infinitive (or gerund) of ná; see ná #1. (PE17:68)
Návarot noun "Nogrod" (< Novrod), Hollowbold, name of a dwelling of the Dwarves (WJ:389). If the element that is here translated náva is the same as náva "mouth", the initial n comes from earlier ng (ñ) and should be represented by the letter noldo rather than númen in Tengwar writing. However, Tolkien in WJ:414 reconstructs the primitive form of the náva in Návarot as ¤nābā rather than **ngābā or **ngāwā (the likely source of náva "mouth"), so this appears doubtful. The initial n of Návarot should evidently be represented by the letter númen in Tengwar writing.
Návatar noun a title of Aulë referring to his position as the immediate author of the Dwarvish race, apparently including atar "father", but the first element cannot be related to any known term for "Dwarf" (PM:391 cf. 381)
náva-tengwë noun *"mouth-sign" = "consonant" considered as a phoneme (only pl. náva-tengwi ["ñáva-"] is attested). Also #návëa. Fëanor later substituted the term #pataca (VT39:8)
#návëa noun  or adj. "consonant" (only pl. návëar ["ñ"] is attested) (VT39:8)
-ndë (1) noun ending; forming nouns from verbal stems in arcandë "petition" and ulundë "stream" (q.v. and cf. VT44:8), feminine in Serindë "broideress" or "needle-woman" (q.v.)  PE17:69 mentions -ndë as a common suffix denoting feminine agent.
[#-ndë (2) pronominal suffix for dual “you”, as in carindë *“you (two) do”. Tolkien changed the ending to -stë (VT49:33)]
-ndil (also -dil) ending occurring in many names, like Amandil, Eärendil; it implies devotion or disinterested love and may be translated "friend" (SA:(noun)dil); this ending is "describing the attitude of one to a person, thing, course or occupation to which one is devoted for its own sake" (Letters:386). Compare -ndur. It is unclear whether the names derived with the ending -ndil are necessarily masculine, though we have no certain example of a woman's name in -ndil; the name Vardilmë (q.v.) may suggest that the corresponding feminine ending is -(n)dilmë.
-ndon, case-ending for “similative”: wilwarindon “like a butterfly” (see wilwarin), laurendon “like gold” (PE17:58) In the post-LotR period Tolkien decided to abandon this ending, apparently because it was to similar to the agental suffix -ndo (PE17:58), and it does not appear in the Plotz decension.
	-ndor, final element in compounds: "land" (Letters:308, UT:253) 
	-ndur (also -dur), ending in some names, like Eärendur; as noted by Christopher Tolkien in the Silmarillion Appendix it has much the same meaning as -ndil "friend"; yet -ndur properly means "servant of" (SA:(noun)dil), "as one serves a legitimate master: cf. Q. arandil king's friend, royalist, beside arandur 'king's servant, minister'. But these often coincide: e.g. Sam's relation to Frodo can be viewed either as in status -ndur, in spirit -ndil." (Letters:286)
	ne (1) noun (or root?) “scent” (PE17:100)
	ne (2) conj. "that" (as in "I know that you are here") (PE14:54), evidently replaced by i in Tolkien’s later Quenya (see i #3).
	ne (3) ??? = n- in n-alalmino (Narqelion) 
	#-ne (4) “I”, a 1st person pronominal suffix occurring in the word melánë “I love” (LR:61), but Tolkien later used -n or -nyë for this meaning (melin “I love”, VT49:21). It may be that Tolkien at one point considered ne (or nye, inyë) as an independent emphatic pronoun “I”, but this was struck out (VT49:49).
	né vb. “was”; see ná #1. Also used as interjection “yes” when the meaning is “it was so, it was as you say/ask” (VT49:31). Pl. nér “were”, dual nét (VT49:30). Nésë “he was” (VT49:29), though Tolkien elsewhere stated that né did not “take any inflection of person” (VT49:31), pronominal endings rather being added to ane- (the form anes “he was” is attested). Anda né “long ago” (VT49:31).
	ne-súmë ??? (Narqelion)
	nëa (1) “once, at one time” (in the past) (VT49:31). Also néya.
	nëa (2) an optative form of the verb na- "to be"? (nëa = LotR-style Quenya nai?): ya rato nëa *"which soon may (it) be" = *"which I hope will be soon" (Arct)
	nec- prefix “without, -less” (PE17:167), cf. -enca, q.v.
	néca ("k") adj  "pale, vague, faint, dim to see", pl. nécë ("k") in Markirya
	neccë (“k”) noun “angle” (PE17:45). Variant of nehtë #1, q.v.
	necel (“k”) noun “thorn” (PE17:55)
	nectë noun "honey" (LT1:262; Tolkien's later Quenya has lis; otherwise, nectë would have had to become nehtë, a form appearing in the Etymologies with the meaning "honeycomb" [VT45:38]. However, this word clashes with nehtë “angle” or "spearhead, gore, wedge, narrow promontory" from later sources [PE17:55, UT:282].)
	nehta (1) noun "spearhead", isolated from nernehta, q.v.
	#nehta- (2) vb. "to slay" if such a stem can be isolated from #nehtar (see below). The (variant?) form nahta- is given in VT49:24.
	nehta- (3) vb. “deprive” (PE17:167)
	nehtanō noun “one deprived, excile whose rights and goods have been confiscated“ (PE17:167). The long final vowel would be a feature of very archaic Quenya; the later form must be *nehtano. 
	#nehtar noun "slayer", isolated from Morinehtar "Darkness-slayer" (PM:384, 385). It may be that a verbal stem #nehta- "to slay, kill" can also be isolated from this noun, though the attested form is actually nahta- (a possible example of A/E variation).
	nehtë (1) noun “angle” (PE17:55), any formation or projection tapering to a point: a spearhead, gore, wedge, narrow promontory (UT:282). Variant neccë.
	nehtë (2) noun "honeycomb" (VT45:38)
neitë noun "wax" (GL:60; rather líco in Tolkien's later Quenya. The status of the diphthong ei is uncertain; in the LotR appendices, Tolkien did not list ei among the Quenya diphthongs, so perhaps the word neitë from an early source is conceptually obsolete also in terms of phonology.)
	nel adv. “thrice”, also nel- (prefix) "tri-" (PE14:84, NEL). Compare neldë.
	nelcë ("k") noun "tooth", also nelet (VT46:3)
	nelci ("k") pl. of nelet (and nelcë), q.v. (NÉL-EK)
	neldë cardinal "three" (SA:neldor, NÉL-ED, VT47:11, VT48:6). Eleni neldë “three stars”, archaic elenion neldë = *“of stars three”. Genitive “of 3 stars” = elenion neldë (for archaic elenion neldëo) (VT49:45; see 54 regarding neldion as the gen. pl.) Cf. also nelya, neldëa, Neldië.
neldëa ordinal "third" (VT42:25); also nelya. Cf. neldë.
neldesta fraction "one third" (1/3), also nelesta, nelsat, nelta. (VT48:11)
Neldië noun "Trinity" (VT44:17)
	Neldion noun *"Day of the three [younger gods]", sc. Ossë, Orome and Tulkas (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK). Elsewhere neldion appears as as the genitive plural form of neldë “three” (VT49:54), but Tolkien emended the relevant text.
	neldor noun "beech" (LT2:343)
	?nelequë ("kw") cardinal "thirteen" (VT48:21). The spelling "nelekwe" occurring in the primary source could suggest that this is really a Common Eldarin form; if so, one could theorize that the Quenya form would be *nelquë with syncope of the middle vowel (the same source lists "minikwe" as a word for 11, and the Quenya form is known to be minque). Compare nelquëa. On the other hand, "tolokwe" as a word for 18 is listed together with definite Quenya forms and is apparently an unorthodox spelling of *toloquë (as observed by the editor); here no syncope producing *tolquë occurs. Thus toloquë could support ?nelequë as the Quenya word (but because of the uncertainties, yunquentë may be preferred as the word for 13).
nelesta fraction "one third" (1/3), also neldesta, nelsat, nelta. (VT48:11)
	nelet, also nelcë ("k") noun "tooth", pl. nelci ("k") suggesting a stem-form nelc- (NÉL-EK)
	nellë noun "brook" (NEN)
	nelma noun “needle” (QL:65)
	nelquëa, cardinal "thirteen" (?) (VT48:21). This looks like an odd form next to other cardinals that simply end in -quë (like lepenquë, enenquë, otoquë = 15, 16, 17), and the form "nelekwe" also listed may indicate another Quenya form nelequë (q.v.) or *nelquë (but because of the uncertainties, yunquentë may be preferred as the word for 13). By another theory, nelquëa is the ordinal "thirteenth", corresponding to the cardinal *nel(e)quë.
nelsat fraction "one third" (1/3), also neldesta, nelesta, nelta (VT48:11)
nelta fraction "one third" (1/3), also neldesta, nelesta, nelsat (VT48:11)
	neltil (neltild-, as in pl. neltildi) noun "triangle" (TIL, NEL)
	nelya adj. "third" (VT42:25; also neldëa). Pl. Nelyar "Thirds", the original name of the Teleri (or rather the direct Quenya descendant of the original Primitive Quendian name) (WJ:380).
	Nelyafinwë noun "Finwë third" (after the original Finwë and Curufinwë = Fëanor), masc. name; he was called Maedhros in Sindarin. Short Quenya name Nelyo. (PM:352)
	Nelyo see Nelyafinwë
	nem- vb. “sew” (cited in the form neme), pa.t. néme (QL:65)
	[#nem- vb.  "judge", attested as endingless aorist nemë, changed by Tolkien to hamë and finally to navë "in all but one case" (Bill Welden). Forms like námo "judge" and namna "statute" point rather to #nam- (q.v.) as a verb "to judge" (VT42:34); the verb namin "I judge" is even listed in Etym.]
	nen noun "river" (LT1:248), "river, water" (LT1:262) (In Tolkien's later Quenya, nén with a long vowel means "water", but hardly "river" - that is sírë.) 
	-nen instrumental ending (pl. -inen, dual -nten, partitive pl. -línen). Attested in ambartanen, lírinen, lintieryanen, súrinen, parmanen; see ambar (#2), lírë, lintië, súrë, parma. Tolkien noted that “most nouns have an instrumental in -nen” (PE17:62), a wording suggesting that the form of the ending may vary; given the normal development ln > ld, it is possible that it would appear as *-den when added to a noun in -l (*macilden “with a sword”).
	nén (nen-) noun "water" (NEN).
	néna adj. "wet" (PE17:167). Cf. nenya, mixa.
	Nénar noun name of a star (or planet), evidently derived from nén "water" (Silm), tentatively identified with Uranus (MR:435)
	nenda (1) adj. wet" (PE17:167; primitive form nendā in the Etymologies, entry NEN, originally misprinted as nenda; cf. VT46:3 for correction)
	[nenda] (2) adj. "sloping" (DEN, struck out)
	nendë (1) noun "pool" (NEN), “lake” (PE17:52)
	[nendë] (2) noun "slope, hillside" (DEN, struck out; compare VT45:9)
	Nendili noun "Water-lovers", the most frequently used "title" or secondary name of the Lindar (Teleri) (WJ:411) Sg. #Nendil.
	nengwë (stem *nengwi-, given the primitive form ¤neñ-wi) noun "nose", pl. nengwi given (NEÑ-WI)
	nengwëa adj. or noun "nasal" (NEÑ-WI)
	Nénimë noun second month of the year, "February" (Appendix D)
	nén-talma noun Quenya cognate of Sindarin nindalf “wet flat” = Wetwang (PE17:52, 167)
	nénu noun "yellow water-lily" (LT1:248)
	nénuvar noun "pool of lilles" (LT1:248)
	nenya adj. “wet” (PE17:52), also néna, q.v. Nenya as the name of a Ring of Power seems to imply *“(thing) related to water”, since this Ring was associated with that element (SA:nen).
	nér (1) (ner-, as in pl. neri) noun "man" (adult male – elf, mortal, or of other speaking race) (MR:213, VT49:17, DER, NDER, NI1, VT45:9; see also WJ:393)
	nér (2) pl. vb. “were”; see né and ná #1 (VT49:30)
	nerca adj. “sharp, angular” (PE17:55), variant nexa (reading uncertain).
	nercë ("k") noun "little man", a diminutive of nér (VT47:33). VT48:18 seems to hint that -cë is to be derived from older -ki; if so, nercë should have the stem-form nerci-. Compare wenci.
	nerdo noun "large, strong man" (compare nér) (VT47:33)
	neresta fraction "one ninth" (1/9), also nesta, nersat. (VT48:11)
	Nermi noun "a field-spirit" (LT1:262)
	nernehta noun "man-spearhead", a battle-formation (UT:282)
	nersat fraction "one ninth" (1/9), also neresta, nesta (VT48:11)
	nertë cardinal "nine" (NÉTER, VT42:26, VT48:6); nertëa ordinal "ninth" (VT42:25)
nes- ?verb/?root “sweet smelling” (PE17:100); cf. Nísimaldar
nesë (apparently with stem nesi-) (Þ) noun “[person of] female [nature]” (PE17:190)
	nésa (Þ) noun "sister" (VT47:14); this form from a late source possibly replaces earlier seler and onórë, q.v.
	nésë (Þ) noun "youth", also nessë (NETH). Not to be confused with nésë “he was”; see ná #1.
	nessa adj. "young" (NETH), also Nessa as name of a Valië, the spouse of Tulkas (adopted and adapted from Valarin, or an archaic Elvish formation: WJ:404 vs. 416). Also called Indis, "bride" (NETH, NI1). The fem. name Nessanië (UT:210) would seem to incorporate Nessa's name; the second element could mean "tear" (nië), but since Nessa is not normally associated with sorrow, this #nië is perhaps rather a variant of ní "female" (compare Tintanië as a variant of Tintallë).
	nessamelda adj. "Nessa-beloved", name of a tree (UT:167)
	Nessaron noun *"[Day] of the younger [gods]", sc. Ossë, Oromë and Tulkas (in Tolkien's earlier conception, Ossë was a "god" or Vala). (LEP/LEPEN/LEPEK)
	nessë noun "youth"; also nésë (NETH)
	nesselë noun “pasture, pasturage” (QL:65)
	nessima adj. "youthful" (NETH)
	nesta fraction "one ninth" (1/9), also neresta, nersat (VT48:11)
	né vb. in pa.t. “was”; see ná #1. 
	nét dual vb. “were”; see né and ná #1 (VT49:30).
	netë *"one more, another", used in enumerating a series: e.g. 1, 2, (3), netë, netë, netë...with netë used instead of citing the actual numbers. (VT47:15, VT48:14-15, 31)
	neterquë cardinal "nineteen" (VT48:21)
	netil noun "trinket, [?small thing] of personal adornment" (Tolkien's gloss was not certainly legible) (VT47:33)
	nettë (stem *netti-, given the primitive form listed in VT47:17) noun "girl, daughter" (but also "sister", see below), also used as a play-name of the "fourth finger" or "fourth toe" (VT47:10, VT48:6), in two-hand play also used for the numeral "nine" (nettë is conceived as being related to nertë, q.v.) Nettë is also defined as "sister" or "girl approaching the adult" (VT47:16, VT49:25), "girl/daughter" (VT47:15-16); it may be that "sister" was Tolkien's final decision on the meaning (VT48:4, 22) - The related word nésa seems like a less ambiguous translation of "sister".
	netya- 1) vb. "to trim, adorn" (VT47:33)
	netya 2) adj. "pretty, dainty" (VT47:33)
	neuma noun "snare" (SNEW)
	neuna adj. "second" (NDEW)
	neuro noun "follower, successor" (NDEW)
	nev- vb. “try” (PE17:167; Tolkien in the source expresses uncertainty as to whether this word should be adopted or not)
	nexa adj. “sharp, angular” (PE17:55; the editor indicates that the reading is uncertain, so the variant nerca may be preferred.)
néya, see nëa #1
-ngo “we (two)”, abandoned pronominal ending for the 1st person dual inclusive (later revised by Tolkien to -ngwë/-nquë). An alternative form -lmo was also listed (VT49:48). The ending -ngo was probably meant to represent older *-ngwo (VT49:49).
	ngoldo see noldo
	-ngwa “our”, 1st person dual inclusive possessive pronominal ending: *“thy and my”, corresponding to the ending -ngwë for dual inclusive “we” (VT49:16)
	ngwalmë see nwalmë
	-ngwë “we”, 1st person dual inclusive pronominal ending: *“thou and I” (compare the exclusive dual form -mmë). Caringwë, *“the two of us do” (VT49:16). One source lists the ending as “-inke > -inque” instead (VT49:51, 53, 57; “inke” was apparently Old Quenya). In an earlier pronoun table reproduced in VT49:48, the ending -ngwë is listed as an alternative to -lmë, which Tolkien at the time used as the plural inclusive ending (a later revision made it plural exclusive).
	ngwen, possible correction of ngwin, q.v. (VT49:55)
	ngwin dative pronoun ?"for us" (VT21:6-7, 10, VT44:36). Apparently belonging to the 1st person pl. It would be pronounced *nwin at the end of the Third Age, but since Tolkien in another source implies that the 1st pl. exclusive base ñwe had the "independent" stem we- in Quenya (VT48:10), we must assume that the dative pronoun should rather be *wen, or in Exilic Quenya *ven. The form ngwin may reflect another conceptual phase when Tolkien meant the nasal element of ñwe to be preserved in Quenya as well. The vowel i rather than e is difficult to account for if the base is to be (ñ)we. In VT49:55, Carl F. Hosttetter suggests that ngwen rather than ngwin may actually be the correct reading of Tolkien’s manuscript.
	ni (1) 1st person sg. pron. "I" (according to PE17:68 also “me” as object), with long vowel (ní) when stressed (VT49:51), cf. ní nauva next to nauvan for *“I will be” (VT49:19), the former wording emphasizing the pronoun. The pronoun ni represents the original stem-form (VT49:50). Dative nin "for me, to me" (Arct, Nam, RGEO:67, VT41:11/15). Compare the reflexive pronoun imni, imnë *"myself" and the emphatic pronoun inyë, q.v. – The ancient element ni is said to have implied, originally, “this by me, of my [?concern]” (VT49:37)
	†ní (2) noun "woman, female" (NI1, INI (NĒR ) ). Not to be confused with ní as a stressed form of the pronoun ni “I”.
	ní (3) prep. “beneath, not touching, under” (PE17:95)
	níca ("k") adj. "small". The word is said to mean "small" with "good senses"; contrast nípa, *nimpë. (VT47:26, VT48:18)
	nícë "little finger" (VT48:5, 15), also lepincë
nicu- ("k") vb. "be chill, cold (of weather); to snow, it is cold, it freezes" (WJ:417, PE17:168): 3rd sg. aorist niquë (q.v.) “it snows or freezes”, present níqua “it is freezing”, pa.t. nicunë “it snowed, froze” (PE17:168)
	nië noun "tear" (NEI, VT45:38, LT1:262, LT2:346); apparently níe in MC:221
	Niélë fem. name (meaning unclear, cf. nië “tear”?), diminutive Nieliccilis ("k") noun "little Niéle" (MC:215; PE16:96). This may suggest that Niélë has the stem-form *Niéli-.
	Niellúnë noun "Sirius" (a star), also Nierninwa (LT1:262)
	nienaitë adj. "bleared" (MC:214), *"tearfully"??? (see cildë) (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	nieninquë ("q") noun  "snowdrop", etymologically "white tear" (NIK-W, LT1:262, 266)
	nieninquëa ("q") adj. "snowdrop-like" (MC:215)
	Nienna noun (name of a Valië, related to nië = tear) (NEI)
	nier noun "honey-bee" (LT1:262)
	niermë ??? (Narqelion)
	Nierninwa noun "Sirius" (a star), also Niellúnë (LT1:262)
	nierwes noun "hive" (LT1:262)
	[nihtil noun "little finger" (VT47:26)]
	-nil, final element in compounds, similar in meaning to Old English "-wine", sc. "-friend" as an element in names (NIL/NDIL). Also long -nildo (VT46:4). Variant of -ndil. In Eärnil, contraction of Earendil. 
	nilda adj. "friendly, loving" (NIL/NDIL)
	nildë noun "friend" (fem.) (NIL/NDIL)
	nildo noun "friend" (apparently masc.; contrast nildë) (NIL/NDIL)
	nillë ("ñ") a star-imagine on Nur-menel (q.v.), from a stem ngil- noun "silver glint" (MR:388)
	nilmë noun "friendship" (NIL/NDIL)
	nilmo noun "friend" (apparently masc.) (NIL/NDIL)
	nimpa adj. “drooping, ailing” (PE17:168)
	*nimpë (nimpi-) adj. "small; small & frail". The form is given as "nimpi" with the last vowel marked as short; this is probably the etymological form that would underlie Quenya *nimpë. The word is said to mean "small" with "connotation of weakness". Also nípa (VT48:18)
	nin pron. "to me, for me", dative of ni (FS, Nam). Sí man i yulma nin enquantuva? “Now who will refill the cup for me?” (Nam), nás mara nin *”it is good to me” = “I like it” (VT49:30), ecë nin carë sa *”it-is-open for me to do it” = “I can do it” (VT49:34). See also ninya.
	#nína (gen.pl. nínaron attested) noun "woman" (VT43:31; this word, as well as some other experimental forms listed in the same source, seem ephemeral: several sources agree that the Quenya word for "woman" is nís, nis [q.v.])
	*nincë (ninci-) ("k") adj. "small". The form is given as "ninki" with the last vowel marked as short; this is probably the etymological form that would underlie Quenya *nincë. The word is said to mean "small" with "good senses"; contrast nípa, *nimpë. (VT48:18)
	nindë adj. "slender" (NIN-DI, pointing to a stem-form nindi-). Not to be confused with *nindë as the likely pa.t. of the verb nir-, q.v.
	ninquanéron ("q") adj. "white shining" (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
	ninquë adj. "white, chill, cold, palid" (WJ:417, SA:nim, PE17:168, NIK-W - spelt "ninqe" in Etym and in LT1:266, MC:213, MC:220, GL:60), pl. ninqui in Markirya. Compounded in Ninquelótë noun *"White-Flower" (SA:nim), = Sindarin Nimloth, the White Tree of Númenor; ninqueruvissë ("q") "white-horse-on" (MC:216; this is "Qenya", read *ninqueroccossë or *ninquiroccossë in LotR-style Quenya). Normally ninquë would be expected to have the stem-form ninqui-, given the primitive form ¤ninkwi; Ninquelótë rather than *Ninquilótë must be seen as an analogical form.
	ninquissë ("q") noun "whiteness" (NIK-W)
	ninquiraitë (“kw”) noun ?”pallor” (PE17:55). The word is cited as the cognate of Sindarin niphred “pallor, fear”. The spelling in the source is “ninkwiraite”, but the word cannot be intended as Old Sindarin (since kw had already become p in that language). 
	ninquita- ("q") vb. "shine white" (NIK-W)
	ninquitá- ("q") vb. "whiten" (NIK-W)
	ninwa adj. "blue" (LT1:262)
	ninya possessive pron occurring in Fíriel's Song, evidently meaning "my"; see indo-ninya. It may be derived from the dative form nin "for me" by adding the adjectival ending -ya. Compare menya, q.v.
nion noun "bee" (GL:60)
nípa adj. "small; small & frail". The word is said to mean "small" with "connotation of weakness". Also *nimpë (VT48:18)
niquë (1) vb. "it is cold, it freezes; it snows or freezes" (WJ:417, PE17:168), 3rd sg. of nicu-, q.v.
niquë (2) ("q") noun "snow" (NIK-W)
níquetil noun “snow peak” (PE17:168), stem probably *níquetild-, cf. Taniquetil, q.v. 
niquetil ("q") noun "snowcap" (LT1:266). Compare níquetil in much later material.
niquis noun "frost-patterns; ice-flake or snowflake – also petal (loose) of a white flower" (stem niquits- or niquiss-), also niquessë by association with quessë "feather" (WJ:417, PE17:168). In early "Qenya", the gloss was simply "snow" (LT1:266).
nir- vb. "press, thrust, force (in a given direction)" ("Though applicable to the pressure of a person on others, by mind and 'will' as well as by physical strength, [this verb] could also be used of physical pressures exerted by inanimates.") Given as a 1st person aorist nirin (VT41:17). Pa.t. probably *nindë since the R of nir- was originally D (the base is given as NID; compare rer- pa.t. rendë from RED concerning the past tense)
	níra noun "will" (as a potential or faculty) (VT39:30, VT41:6, 17, PE17:168)
nírë noun "tear" (NEI)
nirmë noun "an act of will, exercise of will" (VT39:30, VT41:6, PE17:168), "the act or action of níra" (VT41:17)
	nirwa (1) noun  "bolster, cushion" (NID)
	[nirwa (2) adj. "scarred" (VT46:4)]
	[nirwë noun  "scar" (VT46:4)]
	nís (niss-, as in pl. nissi) noun "woman" (MR:213. The Etymologies gives nis (or nissë), pl. nissi: see the stems NDIS-SĒ/SĀ, NI1, NIS (NĒR), VT46:4; compare VT47:33. In Tolkien's Quenya rendering of Hail Mary, the plural nísi occurs instead of nissi; this form is curious, since nísi would be expected to turn into *nízi, *níri (VT43:31). VT47:33 suggests that Tolkien at one point considered niþ- as the older form of the stem, which etymology would solve this problem (since s from older þ does not become z > r). Even so, the MR forms, nís with stem niss-, may be preferred. - Compare †ní, #nína, nisto, Lindissë.
	#nísima adj. "fragrant", isolated from Nísimaldar, q.v.
	Nísimaldar noun "Fragrant trees", a region in Númenor (UT:167; evidently #nísima "fragrant", attested here only, + aldar "trees").
	Nísinen noun *"Fragrance-water", a lake in Númenor (UT:168)
	nissë noun "woman" (NDIS-SĒ/SĀ, NI1, NIS, VT47:33); see nís. Note: nissë could apparently also mean "in me", the locative form of the 1st person pronoun ni, q.v.
	nisto noun "large woman" (compare nís) (VT45:33)
	nítë (stem *níti-, given the primitive form ¤neiti) adj. "moist, dewy" (NEI, VT45:38)
	#nitya adj. "small" (VT48:15, PM:365)
	[nityë noun, ephemeral word for "little finger", changed to nícë (VT48:15)
	nívë adj."pale" (MC:213; this is "Qenya" – Tolkien's later Quenya has néca)
nixë noun "frost" (WJ:417); previously described as a synonym of niquis “ice-flake or snowflake”, q.v. (PE17:168)  
	-nna "to, at, upon", allative ending, originating from -na “to” with fortified n, VT49:14. Attested in cilyanna, coraryanna, Endorenna, Elendilenna, númenórenna, parma-restalyanna, rénna, senna, tielyanna, q.v. If a noun ends in -n already, the ending -nna merges with it, as in Amanna, formenna, Elenna, númenna, rómenna as the allative forms of Aman, formen, elen, númen, rómen (q.v.). Plural -nnar in mannar, valannar, q.v. 
	no prep. "under" (NŪ; all other sources give nu instead. In early "Qenya", no meant "upon"; MC:214) 
	nó (1) (stem nów- as in pl. nówi) noun "conception" (= idea) (NOWO). In an earlier version, later deleted, nó represented earlier ñó (ngó), glossed "idea, thought" (VT46:6).
	nó (2) conj.  "but" (VT41:13)
	nó (3) prep. “before” (of time, compare nóvo), “at back” (of spatial relationships). In other conceptual phases, Tolkien also let the word have the opposite meaning “after” (of time) or “in front” (of space). (VT49:32).
	noa (1) noun "conception" (= idea) (NOWO)
	noa (2) adj. “former”, also adv. (and noun?) “yesterday”, shortened from the full phrase noa ré “former day” (VT49:34). In other conceptual phases, Tolkien used noa for “tomorrow” (VT49:20). Compare enwa.
	[noa (3) noun "thigh" (VT46:4)]
	Nócoirë noun alternative name of March (PM:135)
	noi noun "lament" (NAY)
	#noirë noun "tomb", isolated from Noirinan, q.v. This compound may suggest that noirë has the stem-form noiri-, unless the compound is supposed to contain a plural form "tombs".
	Noirinan noun the "Valley of the Tombs" in Númenor (evidently *noirë, *noiri- "tomb" + nan "valley") (UT:166)
	ñol- noun "smell" (VT45:5); strengthened aññol, q.v. Possibly ñol- should be regarded as simply the root underlying olmë, q.v.
	nóla  ("ñ") (1) adj. "wise, learned" (ÑGOL) (note that this and the next nóla would be spelt differently in Tengwar writing, and originally they were also pronounced differently, since nóla "wise, learned" was ñóla in First Age Quenya). 
	nóla (2) noun "round head, knoll" (NDOL)
	Nólairë noun alternative name of July (PM:135)
†ñolda adj. “dark-haired” (PE17:125), associated with Noldor and hence not much used. Cf. nolya.
noldarë noun "mole"; also nolpa (GL:30)
	noldo (ñ) noun "one of the people of the Noldor", "one of the wise folk, Gnome". Cf. the gloss "Gnome" in early "Qenya" (LT1:262). Also name of tengwa #19, that is used for the initial n of noldo in Tengwar spelling. Originally pronounced ngoldo (also spelt ñoldo by Tolkien, ÑGOLOD); initial ng had become n in Third Age pronunciation (Appendix E). Pl. Noldor ("Ñoldor"), "the Wise", name of the second clan of the Eldar (WJ:380, 381); gen. pl. Noldoron "of the Noldor" is attested (VT39:16)
	Noldolantë (ñ) noun "the Fall of the Noldor" (name of a song) (Silm)
	Noldomar (ñ) noun "Gnomeland" (LT1:262).
	Noldomírë (ñ) lit. noun *"Noldo-jewel", another word for Silmaril (ÑGOLOD).
Noldo-quentasta ("Ñoldo-") noun "Noldo-history", History of the Noldor (VT39:16)
	Noldóran ("ñ") noun "King of the Noldor" (PM:343; evidently noldo + aran).
	Noldorinwa (ñ) adj. *"Gnomish", "Noldorin", "of the Noldor" (LT1:262, VT39:16); lower-case noldorinwa in Narqelion.
	nólë (ñ) noun "long study (of any subject), lore, knowledge" (SA:gûl, also WJ:383 and MR:350, there spelt ñóle, the earlier pronunciation. In the Etymologies, stem ÑGOL, the gloss is "wisdom".) Compare Nólion. At one point, Tolkien was dissatisfied with ÑGOL as the stem for “wisdom” and introduced the form núlë (q.v.) of slightly dissimilar meaning (PE17:125).
	nólemë (ñ) noun "deep lore, wisdom" (LT1:263). Perhaps replaced by Nolmë in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	Nólion (ñ?), second name of Vardamir Nólion (UT:210). Perhaps "son of knowledge", nólë (q.v.) + -ion "son", which ending displaces a final -ë (compare Aranwion "son of Aranwë", UT:50 cf. 32)
	Nolmë ("ñ") noun "knowledge, Philosophy (including Science)" (PM:360 cf. 344)
	nolmo ("ñ") noun "wise person" (PM:360)
	Nolofinwë ("ñ") masc. name "Fingolfin" (PM:344)
	Nolondil (ñ?) masc. name, perhaps "friend of lore/knowledge", the initial element nolo- reflecting the root ÑGOL having to do with knowledge (cf. nolo- in Nolofinwë) + -ndil "friend" (UT:210)
nolpa "mole"; also noldarë (GL:30)
	nolwë ("ñ") noun "wisdom, secret lore" (ÑGOL)
	nolya (“ñ”) adj. “dark-haired” (PE17:125), i.e. very dark brown
	#nómë noun "place", isolated from Nómesseron, q.v. Cf. also sinomë.
Nómesseron pl. noun in genitive: a compound "of place-names", apparently an inflected compound consisting of #nómë "place" + a genitive plural #esseron "of names" (VT42:17; we might have expected *ession, since essi rather than ?esser as the nominative plural of essë "name" is attested both in PM:339 and MR:470)
[ñon, noun  "groan" (gloss changed by Tolkien from "growl") (VT46:6)]
	[ñona- vb.  "groan" (VT46:6)]
	nonda noun "hand, especially in [?clutching]" (VT47:23; Tolkien's gloss was not certainly legible)
	Nóquellë noun alternative name of October (PM:135); otherwise called Narquelië
	nor- vb. “run (or leap: of animals, men etc.)”, pa.t. nornë (PE17:58, 168); cf. nórima, nornoro-
	nór noun "land" (stem nor-, PE17:106) – this is land as opposed to water and sea (nor in Letters:308). Cf. nórë. 
	[ñor noun? prefix? “fear” (PE17:172)]
	nordo noun “oak” (PE17:25), possibly replacing norno (q.v.) in a pre-LotR source.
	nórë noun "land" (associated with a particular people) (WJ:413), "country, land, dwelling-place, region where certain people live, race, clan" (NŌ, NDOR, BAL), also used = "race, tribe, people" (SA:dôr, PE17:169; however, the normal word for "people" is lië). Early "Qenya" has nórë "native land, nation, family, country" (in compounds -nor) (LT1:272) 
	norië, also normë, noun “race, running“ (PE17:169)
	#nórië noun "country", in sindanórië (see sinda) (Nam, RGEO:67)
	nórima adj. “strong/swift at running” (VT49:29); see nor-
	normë = norië, q.v.
norna adj. "stiff, tough; hard, firm, resistant" (WJ:413, PE17:106), “thrawn, tough, obdurate”, mainly applied to persons (PE17:181)
	norno (1) noun "oak" (DÓRON); a later source has nordo (PE17:25)
	Norno (2) noun "dwarf"; a personalized form of the adjective norna (WJ:413); Nornalië (not *Nornolië) the "Dwarf-people" as a whole (WJ:388)
	nornoro- vb. "run on, run smoothly" (LT1:263). Compare nor-.
	norolinda adj. “lightly tripping” (PE16:96), compare “Qenya” norolindë with similar meaning (MC:215)
norollë noun "cart" (GL:31)
	Norrívë noun alternative name of December (PM:135), otherwise called Ringarë.
	norsa (þ) noun "giant" (NOROTH) 
norta- vb. (1) “make run, specially used of riding horses or other animals”, onortanen rocco “I rode a horse”, nortanen “I rode” (with ellipsis of object; the prefix o- must apparently be included if the animal one rides on is mentioned as a direct object) (PE17:168)
ñorthus, ñorsus (-þus), (stem ñorsúr-) noun Quenya equivalent of Sindarin Gorthu “Mist of Fear”, a name of Sauron (PE17:183). The word is not capitalized as a name in the source.
norta (ñ) (2) adj. "horrible" (VT46:4. In Tengwar writing, the initial N would be represented by the letter noldo, not númen.)
	nortil (probably *nortill-) noun "a cape (of land), only used of the ends of promontories or other seaward projections that were relatively sharp and spike-like" (VT47:28)
	norto (ñ) noun "a horror" (VT46:4. In Tengwar writing, the initial N would be represented by the letter noldo, not númen.)
	nossë noun "clan, family, 'house' " (NŌ), "kindred, family" (PM:320), "kin, people" (LT1:250, LT1:272, LT2:338)
	nosta noun "birth, birthday" (LT1:272; maybe not a valid word in Tolkien’s later Quenya because the meaning of the corresponding verb was changed from "give birth" to "beget")
	nosta- vb., variously glossed "beget" (SD:73) or passive “be begotten” (PE17:170); in earlier "Qenya" the gloss was "give birth" (LT1:272)
	nostalë noun "species, kind" (LT1:272)
	nostari pl. noun "parents", pl. of *nostar or *nostaro "parent" (LotR3:VI ch. 6, translated in Letters:308)
	not- vb. "reckon" (NOT); compare onot-. Passive participle nótina "counted, *reckoned" (FS), nótima “countable” (PE17:68), #notië *"counting, reckoning" in maquanotië "decimal system" (VT47:10), variant #nótië in caistanótië of similar meaning (VT48:11).
	nótë noun "number" (NOT)

	nótima adj. “countable” (PE17:68, 172), negated únótima “uncountable”, q.v.
	*notto (ñ) noun “enemy”, reconstructed simplex form of the second element of the Moringotto “Dark Enemy”, a Quenya form of Morgoth (VT49:25). Compare #cotto.
	nóvo adv. “previously, before” (?) (PE15:35). Compare nó #3.
	Nótuilë noun alternative name of May (PM:135)
	-nt ending for dual dative (Plotz)
	-nta (1) ending for dual allative (Plotz); see -nna
	-nta (2) possessive 3rd person pl. pronominal ending: “their” (VT49:17). Lintienta “their speed” (PE17:58), nassentar “their true-being[s]” (PE17:175). This ending corresponds to -ntë “they” (other versions of Quenya uses -ltë for “they” and hence -lta for “their”). Also -ntya, q.v. According to VT49:17, the ending -nta appears as -inta following a consonant (other sources point to -e- rather than -i- as the connecting vowel in such cases).
	-ntë “they”, pronomimal ending, inflexion of 3rd person plural when no subject is previously mentioned (CO; see also VT49:49). This ending competes with -ltë (q.v.) in Tolkien’s conception (VT49:57; for “they do”, both carintë and cariltë are attested, VT49:16 vs. 17). The corresponding pronominal possessive suffix appears as -ntya or -nta in various sources.
	-nten ending for dual instrumental (Plotz)
	[-ntyë “you”, abandonded pronominal ending for 2nd person pl. familiar (VT49:49)]
	-ntya, possessive 3rd person pl. pronominal ending: “their” (VT49:17), corresponding to -ntë as the ending for “they”. Besides -ntya the form -nta is also attested, but the latter clashes with the ending for dual allative. (Other variants of Quenya uses -lta for “their”, corresponding to -ltë as the ending for “they”.) According to VT49:17, the ending -ntya appears as -intya following a consonant (other sources point to -e- rather than -i- as the connecting vowel in such cases).
	nu prep. "under" (LR:56, Markirya, Nam, RGEO:66, MC:214; the Etymologies alone gives no [q.v.] instead). In Mar-nu-Falmar, nuhuinenna, q.v. Prefix nú- in nútil, q.v.
	Núaran noun *"West-king"; Núaran Númenoren *"West-king of Númenor"; changed (according to LR:71) to Núraran Númenen, *"West-king of the West" (all of this is "Qenya" with genitive in -n instead of -o, as in Tolkien's later Quenya) (LR:60)
	nucumna ("k") adj. (or passive participle) "humbled" (SD:246). This probably contains a verbal stem #nucum- "to humble, humiliate"; compare naham- with passive participle nahamna (q.v.)
	nuhta- vb. "stunt, prevent from coming to completion, stop short, not allow to continue" (WJ:413)
	nuhuinenna adj. "under shadow" (allativic: nu-huinë-nna "under-shadow-to") (SD:246); see huinë.
	nuinë noun "river (of large volume, and liable to flooding)". The word is said to be archaic, surviving chiefly in topographical names. It comes from earlier duine, hence appearing in that form in a name like Nunduinë (VT48:30-31), apparently also Anduinë (q.v.) Tolkien struck out the paragraph where nuinë occurs, but the names Nunduinë/Anduinë would suggest that the word as such is conceptually valid.
	núla (“ñ”) adj. “dark, occult, mysterious” (PE17:125)
	nulda adj. "secret" (DUL)
	núlë (“ñ”) noun “black arts, secrecy” (PE17:125)
	nulla adj. "dark, dusky, obscure" (NDUL), "secret" (DUL). See also VT45:11.
	numba adj. “bent, humped” (PE17:168)
	[numbë noun "root, foundation", also núvë (VT45:38)]
	númë noun "going down, occident" (Letters:361), “the West” (PE17:18), núme- "west" (VT45:38, LT1:263), “the West”  In númeheruen and numeheruvi, q.v.
	númëa adj. "in the West" (actually an adjective *"western", in Tolkien's later Quenya also númenya) (LT1:263)
	#númeheru noun "Lord of the West" (númë + heru), attested in these inflected forms: 1) númeheruen  *"of [the] Lord of the West" (Manwë) (SD:290); this is "Qenya" with genitive in -en instead of -o as in LotR-style Quenya; 2) pl. númeheruvi "Lords-of-West" (*"West-lords" = Valar) in SD:246.
	númen noun "west, the way of the sunset" (SA:andúnë, cf. NDŪ, MEN; capitalized Númen under SA:men and in CO), "going down, occudent" (Letters:361), also name of tengwa #17 (Appendix E). According to VT45:38, the word is actually cited as "nú-men" in Tolkien's Etymologies manuscript. Allative númenna "Westward" (LR:47, SD:310, VT49:20, capitalized Númenna, VT49:22; numenna with a short u, VT49:23); adj. númenquerna “turned westward” (VT49:18, 20). See also númenyaron, númessier. - In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, "nú-men" was intended as the name of tengwa #21, to which letter Tolkien at this stage assigned the value n (VT45:38). However, this tengwa was later given the Quenya value r instead and was renamed órë.
	Númen(n)órë noun "people of the west", confused with Númendor "land of the west" (SA:dôr); hence Númenor as the name of the great isle given to the Edain by the Valar (FS, LR:56); full form Númenórë (LR:47, SD:247, NDŪ); allative númenórenna "to Númenor" (LR:56)
	numenda- vb. "get low (of the Sun)" (also númeta-) (LT1:263; in Tolkien's later Quenya núta-)
	Númendor noun "land of the west", confused with and replaced by Númen(n)órë "people of the west" (SA:dôr)
	númenya adj. "western" (NDŪ)
	númenyaron inflected adj. used as noun?, a word occurring in a phrase from an earlier version of Fíriel's Song, Valion númenyaron, "of the Lords [Valar] of the West". But númenyaron cannot simply mean "of the West"; it seems to be the plural genitive of númenya "western", hence literally *"of the western (things, persons, realms)" or "of the Westerners".
	Númerrámar noun "West-wings", name of a ship (Númen + rámar, note assimilation nr > rr) (UT:175)
	númessier vb. "they are in the west", a construction occurring in Fíriel's Song, evidently núme(n)-ssë-ie-r "west-in-are-they"; the stative-verb suffix -ië is probably not valid in LotR-style Quenya (FS)
	númeta- vb. "get low (of the Sun)" (also numenda-) (LT1:263; in Tolkien's later Quenya rather núta-); inflected númetar "set" ("went down in the West") (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	Númevalion noun *"of the West-powers" (SD:290); cf. Valion
	nún 1) adv. "down below, underneath" (NŪ) 
núna adj. “western” (PE17:18), compare the element #nún- "west(ern)" in certain compounds, such as Núnatani and Nunduinë, q.v. (in the latter word, ú is apparently shortened as u before a consonant cluster). Compare númen.
	Núnatani noun "Western Men" = Sindarin Dúnedain (WJ:386). Sg. #Núnatan "Dúnadan".
	Nunduinë noun *"West-flow", name of a river in Númenor (UT:168). Compare nuinë. Since this comes from earlier duine, the name appears with the d intact following n: The initial element of Nunduinë is #nún, q.v.
	**nuntixë ("ks"), misreading for unutixë, q.v. 
	nuquerna adj. "reversed", or perhaps rather *"turned upside down". Attested in the phrases silmë nuquerna and árë nuquerna, q.v.
	Nur-menel noun the lesser firmament, a great dome covering Valinor, made by Varda and full of star-imagines (see tinwë, nillë). It was a simulacrum of Tar-menel, the true firmament (MR:388)
	núra adj. "deep" (NŪ)
	núro noun "servant" (NDŪ; in Etym as published in LR, the gloss is misread as "sunset"; see VT45:38)
	Nurquendi ("q") noun "Gnomes" (lit. *"Deep Elves"), sg. *Nurquendë (NŪ)
	nurru- vb. "murmur, grumble" (cf. "Qenya" núru-); participle nurrula in Markirya, changed to nurrua, perhaps a kind of verbal adjective of the same meaning (translated "mumbling" in MC:215)
	#nurta- vb. "hide", verbal stem isolated from nurtalë "hiding", q.v.
	nurtalë noun "hiding" (evidently a verbal stem #nurta- "hide" with the verbal noun ending -lë); Nurtalë Valinóreva "the Hiding of Valinor" (Silm)
	nuru, Nuru noun "death, Death" (ÑGUR). This represents earlier ñuru (VT46:4) and should be spelt accordingly in Tengwar writing. When personalized, Nuru refers to Mandos. Cf. Nurufantur.
	núru- vb. "growl (of dogs), grumble" (LT1:263). Perhaps replaced by nurru- (q.v.) in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	Nurufantur noun "lord of Death-cloud", surname of Mandos (SPAN, ÑGUR)
	nuruhuinë noun "death-shadow" (LR:47, 56, SD:310)
	nustë noun “sense of smell” (QL:68)
	nut- vb. "tie" (1st pers. aorist nutin "I tie") (NUT)
	núta- vb. "set, sink" (of Sun or Moon) (NDŪ). In early "Qenya", the word was glossed "stoop, sink" (LT1:263)
	nútë noun "bond, knot" (NUT)
	nútil (nútill-, pl. nútilli given) noun "under-point", term used in children's play for "toe" (the counterpart of ortil, q.v.) (VT47:10)
	[núvë noun "root, foundation", also numbë (VT45:38)]
	nuxo noun “Petty dwarf” (PE17:45; the spellings “nukso” and “nuxo” both occur in the source). Elsewhere the Petty-dwarves are called Picinaucor or Pitya-naucor, q.v.
	-nwa is said to be “a passive suffix” irregularly occurring in the word vanwa “lost” (PE17:63), the word seems to be irregular since the underlying root means “go away” and so vanwa is in a sense a past active participle, *“having gone”. Compare PE17:68.  
	nwalca ("k") adj. "cruel" (ÑGWAL; this must represent earlier *ñwalca = *ngwalca; these forms are not given in Etym, but compare nwalmë below. In Tengwar writing, the initial NW would be represented by the letter nwalmë.)
	nwalma noun  "pain" (VT46:4. In Tengwar writing, the initial NW would be represented by the letter nwalmë.)
	nwalmë noun  "torment", also name of tengwa #20. Originally pronounced ngwalmë; initial ng had become n in Third Age pronunciation (Appendix E). In Tengwar writing, the initial NW would be represented by the letter nwalmë.
	nwalya- vb. "to pain, torment" (ÑGWAL; this must represent earlier *ñwalya = *ngwalya; these forms are not given in Etym, but compare nwalmë above. In Tengwar writing, the initial NW would be represented by the letter nwalmë.)
	nwin, see ngwin
	-nya pronominal suffix, 1st person sg. possessive, "my" (VT49:16, 38, 48), e.g. tatanya *"my daddy" (UT:191, VT48:17), meldonya *”my [male] friend” (VT49:38), meldenya *"my [female] friend” (Elaine inscription), omentienya *”my meeting” (PE17:68), tyenya “my tye” (tye being an intimate form of “you”), used = “dear kinsman” (VT49:51, 56). This ending seems to prefer i as its connecting vowel where one is needed, cf. Anarinya "my sun" in LR:72, so also in hildinyar "my heirs". It was previously theorized by some that a final -ë would also be changed to -i- before -nya, but the example órenya "my heart [órë]" indicates that this is not the case (VT41:11).
	nyano, see nyarro
	nyar- vb. "to tell" (1st pers. aorist nyarin "I tell") (NAR2, VT45:36). Compare nyárë, nyarië, nyarna.
	nyárë noun "tale, saga, history". Compounded in Eldanyárë "History of the Elves", lumenyárë "history, chronological account" (NAR2, LR:199). Compare nyarië, nyarna.
	nyarië noun “a fable, story, legend” (gerund of nyar-). (QL:68)
	nyarna noun "tale, saga" (NAR2), compounded in nyarmamaitar noun "storyteller" (PE17:163), literally *"tale-artist" (see maitar).
	nyarro noun "rat", the most likely reading of Tolkien's manuscript. Christopher Tolkien originally read the word as "nyano" (so in the published Etymologies, entry NYAD), but the "Noldorin"/Sindarin cognates nadhr, nadhor (VT46:7) indicate that the primitive form is meant to be *nyadrō, which form could hardly yield "nyano" in Quenya.
	-nyë, 1st person sg. pronominal suffix "I"; also short form -n (q.v.). Carin or carinyë *“I do” (VT49:16). With object -s following in utúvienyes “I have found it” (see tuv-). It may be that Tolkien at one point considered nye (or ne, inyë) as an independent emphatic pronoun “I”, but this was struck out (VT49:49).
	[nyel an (incomplete?) word occurring in the deleted entry NYELED in the Etymologies, VT46:7). Compare perhaps the final element of Falanyel, #Solonyel]
	nyelecca ("k") noun "onyx" (PE15:76)
	nyelet noun "nail" (of the finger), pl. nyelexi (PE15:75)
	nyellë noun "bell" (NYEL). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, nyellë was also the name of tengwa #21 with overposed dots to indicate "following y", the whole symbol having the value ny (VT46:7)
	nyello noun "singer" (NYEL). Compare the final element of Falanyel, #Solonyel, q.v
	nyéna- vb. "lament" (LT1:262). Compare naina- in Tolkien’s later Quenya.
	nyéni noun "she-goat" (LT1:262)
	Nyenna noun alternative form of Nienna (LT1:262)
	nyenyë noun "weeping" (LT1:262)
nyérë noun "grief" (LT1:261), "sorrow" (GL:60)

<O>
	†Ó noun "the sea" (poetic word, hardly valid in Tolkien's later Quenya) (LT1:263, there spelt Ô)
	o (1) conj. "and", occurring solely in SD:246; all other sources give ar.
	o (2) prep. "with" (MC:216; this is "Qenya"; WJ:367 states that no independent preposition o was used in Quenya. Writers may rather use as.) See ó- below.
	o (3) prep.? variant (along with au and va) of the stem awa “away from” (VT49:24). It is uncertain whether this o is a Quenya word; Patrick Wynne suggests it could be the first element of the preposition ollo “away from” (ibid.)
	-o (1) genitive ending, as in Altariello, Oromëo, Elenna-nórëo, Rithil-Anamo, Rúmilo, Lestanórëo, neldëo, omentielvo, sindiëo, Valinórëo, veryanwesto, q.v. In words ending in -a, the genitive ending replaces this final vowel, hence atto, Ráno, Vardo, vorondo as the genitive forms of atta, Rána, Varda, voronda (q.v.) Following a noun in -ië, the ending can have the longer form -no, e.g. *máriéno “of goodness” (PE17:59, but contrast sindiëo “of greyness” in PE17:72).  Where the word ends in -o already, the genitive is not distinct in form, e.g. ciryamo (q.v.) = “mariner” or “mariner’s”. Pl. -ion and -ron, q.v.; dual -to (but possibly -uo in the case of nouns that have nominative dual forms in -u rather than -t). The Quenya genitive describes source, origin or former ownership rather than current ownership (which is rather covered by the possessive-adjectival case in -va). The ending -o may also take on an ablativic sense, “from”, as in Oiolossëo “from (Mount) Oiolossë” (Nam), sio “hence” (VT49:18). – In some of Tolkien’s earlier material, the genitive ending was -n rather than -o, cf. such a revision as Yénië Valinóren “Annals of Valinor” becoming Yénië Valinórëo (MR:200).
	-o (2), also -ó, "a person, somebody", pronominal suffix (PM:340)
	ó- (usually reduced to o- when unstressed) a prefix "used in words describing the meeting, junction, or union of two things or persons, or of two groups thought of as units". In omentië, onóna, ónoni, q.v. (WJ:367, PE17:191; in the Etymologies, stem WŌ, the prefix o-, ó- is simply defined as "together".) In VT43:29 is found a table showing how pronominal endings can be added to the preposition ó-; the resulting forms are onyë or óni *"with me", ómë *"with us" [also in VT43:36, where "us" is said to be exclusive], ólyë or ólë *"with you" (olyë only sg. "you", whereas ólë can be either sg. or pl.), ósë *"with him/her", ótë *"with them" (of animates – where "them" refers to non-persons, óta [or shortened ót] is used, though the conceptual validity of ta as a pl. pronoun is questionable), ósa (or shortened ós) "with it". (Two additional forms, ótar and ótari, presumably mean “with them” of inanimate things; see VT49:56 for a possible second attestation of tar as the word for plural inanimate “they”.) However, Tolkien's later decision to the effect that ó- refers to two parties only may throw doubt upon the conceptual validity of some of these forms, where at least three persons would be implied (like ótë "with them", where one person is "with" two or more others – though Tolkien indicates that two groups may also be involved where the preposition ó- is used). The explicit statement in WJ:367 that the prepostion o (variant of ó) did not exist independently in Quenya is however difficult to get around, so instead using the preposition ó/o (with or without endings) for "with", writers may rather use as, the form appearing in the last version of Tolkien's Quenya Hail Mary (also attested with a pronominal suffix: aselyë "with you"). 
	oa (1), also oar ("öa, öar"), adverbs, "away", with the idea of movement away (WJ:366, gloss in VT39:6). Compare au #2. 
	oa (2) noun "wool" (LT1:249; evidently replaced by tó in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	oantë vb. "went away (to another place)"; past tense of auta-. Also perfect oantië. (WJ:366, VT48:32)
	oar (1) = oa #1, q.v. 
	oar (2) noun "child of the sea, merchild" (LT1:263; hardly valid in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Oarel ("Oärel") noun "Elf who departed from Beleriand to Aman" (while the Sindar stayed there). Stem Oareld-, as in pl. Oareldi (WJ:363, 374). Older form Oazeldi.
	oaris (oarits-), also oarwen, noun "mermaid" (LT1:263; read perhaps ëar- for oar- in LotR-style Quenya)
	Oazeldi, Vanyarin (and original) form of Oareldi; see Oarel (WJ:374)
	ócama- vb. "have mercy" (VT44:12-14; Tolkien may have abandoned this form in favour of órava-)
	ocamna ("k") noun "diphthong" (VT44:13)
	occa ("k") noun "knee" (QL:70)
	#ócom- vb. “gather, assemble” (intransitive) (PE17:157, 158). Cited in the form ócomë “gathers, assembles”, evidently an endingless aorist. Perfect ócómië given.
ocombë (“k”) noun “gathering, assembly, assemblage, collection”. Also combë (PE17:158)
ohlon (pl. ohloni is attested) noun "diphthong", used of both vocalic diphthongs and "consonantal diphthongs" like mb (VT39:9)
oholima adj. “confidential” (PE17:129), a form also used to describe the 1st person dual inclusive pronoun.
	ohta noun "war" (OKTA, KOT > KOTH). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, ohta was also the name of tengwa #15 (VT46:7), but Tolkien would later call this letter anca instead – changing its value from ht to nc.
	#ohtacar- stem of the past tense ohtacárë (-"káre") vb. "war-made", made war (+ allative = make war upon) (LR:47, SD:246; ohtacárië in LR:56). The past tense could probably also be *ohtacarnë with the better-attested pa.t. of car- “make”.
	[ohtacáro] ("k") noun "warrior" (KAR). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the accent of the word ohtacáro was omitted (VT45:19).
	ohtar noun "warrior, soldier" (UT:282)
	oi adv. "ever" (OY)
	oia adj. "everlasting" (OY); according to VT46:8 the word is both adjective and adverb. An explicitly adverbial form oiavë is mentioned elsewhere (PE17:74)
	Oiacúma ("k") = Avacúma ("k"), noun the Exterior Void beyond the World (OY, cf. AWA; in the published Etymologies the final -a was misread as -i, see VT46:8)
	oiala adj. “unceasing, without end, forever” (PE17:68)
	oialë noun "everlasting [?age]" (Reading of gloss uncertain) (OY). Also adverb "eternally, in eternity” (PE17:59) or “forever” (PE17:69), so used in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67)
	oialëa adj. “eternal” (PE17:59)
	oïcta ("k") ??? (twice in Narqelion; the combination ct would have to become ht in LotR-style Quenya, and the hiatic combination oï does not occur.)
	oiencarmë Eruo ("k") noun "the One's [Eru's] perpetual production", free rendering: "God's management of the Drama" (MR:471)
	oilima adj. "last" (MC:213, 214; this is "Qenya"), inflected or lengthened form oilimain "last (pl.)" (MC:221), oilimaisen "(MC:221), oilimaite "last" (MC:214, 221) 
	oio noun "an endless period" (CO) or adv. "ever" (SA:los). Oiolairë "Ever-summer" (name of a tree, UT:167; also in the name Coron Oiolairë, "Mound of Ever-summer". Oiolossë "Everwhite, Ever-snowwhite", a name of Taniquetil (OY), hence the translation "Mount Everwhite" in Tolkien's rendering of Namárië. See also SA:los. Explicit "mount" in Oron Oiolossë "Mount Everwhite" (WJ:403). Ablativic genitive Oiolossëo "from Mount Everwhite" in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67, OY)
	Oiomúrë place-name; noun *"Ever-?mist" (Silm)
	oiórië, perfect tense of yor-, q.v. (PE17:43)
	oira adj. "eternal" (OY)
	oirë noun "everlasting [?age]" (Reading of gloss uncertain) (OY)
	ol- vb. "grow" (VT45:13; this may be a primitive root rather than a Quenya verb)
	óla- vb. "to dream" (said to be "impersonal", probably meaning that the dreamer is mentioned in the dative rather than the nominative) (UT:396)
	olassië noun "collection of leaves, foliage" (Letters:283). A shorter form #olassë is apparently present in laicolassë “green-foliage” (PE17:56).
	olba noun "branch" (PM:340; the form *olva may be more frequent; olba can only occur in the Quenya variant that uses lb for lv. The Etymologies, stem GÓLOB, has olwa. See also olvar.)
	olca adj. "evil, bad, wicked" (VT43:23-24, VT48:32, VT49:14, PE17:149). The root meaning implies “wickedness as well as badness or lack of worth” (PE17:170). Variant of ulca.
	olë (1) adv. "much" (PE14:80)
	olë (2) cardinal "three" (LT1:258; in LotR-style Quenya Tolkien replaced this "Qenya" form with neldë)
	ólemë noun "elbow" (LT1:258)
	olla prep “over” (= beyond, of things passed over, as in “I went over a river” or “they went over the hill”) (PE17:65)
	ollo (1) noun "cliff, seaward precipice" (also oldō - is this to be understood as the older form?) (LT1:252)
	ollo (2) prep. “away from” (VT49:24)
	olma cardinal "nine" (LT1:258; in Tolkien's later Quenya nertë)
	olmë noun "odour" (changed by Tolkien from holmë, VT46:6)
	Olofantur noun "lord of Dream-cloud", surname of the Vala Lórien (ÓLOS, SPAN, VT45:28)
	?olo (reading uncertain), possibly a synonym of ló #1, hence noun "night" (VT45:28)
	olombo noun "horse" (derived from a base LOB which Tolkien later changed to LOP; hence read *olompo for olombo?)
oloirë noun "great flood" (VT42:10)
oloiya- vb. "to inundate, flood" (VT42:10)
	olor noun "dream" (LOS, ÓLOS, LT1:259 [the latter source also gives olórë]); perhaps changed by Tolkien to olos, q.v. 
	olórëa adj. "dreamy" (LT1:259 – replaced by olosta, UT:396?) 
	Olórin noun name of the Maia that became Gandalf, connected to olos no. 1 (UT:396)
	olos (1) noun "dream, vision" (olor-, as in pl. olori from earlier olozi) (UT:396). Cf. olor and see lár #2. 
	†olos (2) noun "snow, fallen snow" (prob. oloss-, cf. the longer form olossë below; this form should be preferred since olos also = "dream, vision") (GOLOS)
	†olossë noun "snow, fallen snow" (GOLÓS, LOT[H])
	olosta adj. "dreamy" (UT:396)
olótë noun "bloom, the flowers collectively of a single plant" (VT42:18)
	olpë noun “bottle” (QL:69)
	olvar (sg. #olva) noun "growing things with roots in the earth, *plants" (Silm). Apparently more or less the same word as olwa, olba, which is however glossed “branch”. Cf. laima.
	olwa noun "branch" (GÓLOB). Read perhaps *olva in LotR-style Quenya (since the root indicates that lw originates from lb, which in Tolkien’s later scheme would rather yield lv, reverting to lb in some forms of late pronunciation; the form olba is attested in PM:340). 
	Olwë noun masc. name (PM:340), difficult to interpret (PM:341)
	olwen (olwenn-) noun "branch, wand, stick" (LT2:342)
	olya adj. "much" (PE14:80)
	óma noun "voice" (OM), "voice, resonance of the vocal chords" (VT39:16), “voice /vowel” (PE17:138, where it is said that the root OM refers to “drawn-out” sounds; contrast tomba, q.v.). With pronominal suffix #ómarya "his/her voice", genitive ómaryo "of his/her voice" (Nam, RGEO:67). Instrumental pl. ómainen "with voices" (WJ:391). Adj. ómalóra "voiceless" (VT45:28). The term óma is closely associated with vowels, see óma-tengwë, ómëa; cf. also the compounds ómataina "vocalic extension", the addition to the base a final vowel identical to the stem-vowel (WJ:371, 417; also called ómataima, VT42:24, 25), ómatehtar "vowel-signs", signs used for vowels (usually called simply tehtar, but the latter term strictly includes all kinds of diacritics, not just the vowel-signs) (WJ:396)
	ómalingwe ?"voice-???" (Narqelion; in Tolkien's later Quenya, óma means "voice" or "vowel" and lingwë means "fish", but at least the latter gloss can hardly be relevant here)
#óma-tengwë noun "vowel" (only pl. óma-tengwi attested); this refers to vowels considered as independent phonemes, according to Fëanor's new insights on phonemics. Also #ómëa. (VT39:8; ómatengwi ["ñ"] with no hyphen in VT39:16)
	óman noun "vowel" (stem omand- as in the pl. omandi, which form was misread as "amandi" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry OM; see VT46:7). The terms óma-tengwë, ómëa from a later source are probably to be preferred.
	ómataina, ómataima – see óma.
	ómë prep. + pron. "with us" (exclusive); see ó
#ómëa noun "vowel" (only pl. ómëar attested); this refers to vowels considered as independent phonemes, according to Fëanor's new insights on phonemics. Also #óma-tengwë. (VT39:8)
	ómen prep. + pron. ?"on/for us" (órava ómen "have mercy on us", VT44:12, changed by Tolkien from the simple dative form men "for us", then replaced by (o)messë)
	omentië noun "meeting" (meeting or junction of the directions of two people) (WJ:367), *omentielva "our meeting", only attested in the genitive: omentielvo "of our meeting" (discussed in VT48:11). See -lv-. Concerning the alternative reading omentielmo, see -lma. Omentienya *”my meeting” (PE17:58).– The form omentiemman appears in early material, with the ending -mma (at the time plural inclusive “our”) and the ending -n (at the time the genitive ending) (RS:324, VT49:55)
	omessë, ómessë, see me
	ompa adv. “forward” (VT49:12), also póna
	ómu conj.? word of uncertain meaning occurring in an untranslated "Qenya" text; Christopher Gilson argues that it could mean *"although" (or *"notwithstanding") (PE15:32, 37)
	-on gen.pl. ending (3O), in aldaron, aranion, elenion, Eldaron, #esseron, Ingweron, Istarion, Númevalion, Quendion, Silmarillion, Sindaron, tasarion (see Nan-Tasarion), Valion, wenderon, yénion. Normally the ending -on is added to the nominative plural, whether it ends in -i or -r, but some nouns in -ë that would have nominative plurals in -i seem to prefer the ending -ron in the genitive (hence #esseron as the gen. pl. of essë "name", though the nominative pl. is attested as essi and we might have expected the gen. pl. *ession; similarly wenderon, Ingweron).
	on, ondo noun "stone" (LT2:342, LT1:254 – probably only ondo in LotR-style Quenya, see below). Various "Qenya" forms: ondoli "rocks" (MC:213; this would be a partitive plural in LotR-style Quenya), ondolin "rocks" (MC:220), ondoisen "upon rocks" (MC:221), ondolissen "rocks-on" (MC:214; the latter form, partitive plural locative, is still valid in LotR-style Quenya). 
	ondo noun "stone" as a material, also "rock" (UT:459, GOND). Pl. ondor in an earlier variant of Markirya; partitive pl. locative ondolissë "on rocks" in the final version. Compounded in ondomaitar “sculptor in stone” (PE17:163), Ondoher masc.name, *"Stone-lord" (ondo alluding to Ondonórë = Sindarin Gondor, "stone-land") (Appendix A), #ondolunca (“k”) “stonewain”, possessive form in the place-name Nand’ Ondoluncava “Stonewain Valley” (PE17:28, also Ondoluncanan(do) as a compound). Ondolindë place-name "Gondolin" (SA:gond, J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator p. 193); see Ondo. Earlier "Qenya" has Ondolinda (changed from Ondolin) "singing stone, Gondolin" (LT1:254) 
Ondonórë, #Ondórë place-name "Gondor" (Stone-land). The shorter form of the name is attested in the genitive in the phrase aran Ondórëo, “a king of Gondor”. (VT42:17, VT49:27)
onë conj. "but" (VT43:23)
	ónë one pa.t. of onta- vb. "beget, create" (the pa.t. may also be ontanë) (ONO)
ongwë noun “crime” (PE17:170)
óni, see ó-
	onna noun "creature" (ONO), “child” (PE17:170), also translated "child" in the plural compound Aulëonnar "Children of Aulë", a name of the Dwarves (PM:391), and apparently also used = “child” in the untranslated sentence nai amanya onnalya ter coivierya (“k”) *”be it that your child [will be] blessed thoughout his/her life” (VT49:41). The form onya (q.v.), used as a vocative *"my child", is perhaps shortened from *onnanya.
	ono conj. "but" (VT43:23, VT44:5/9)
	onóna (1) adj. "twin-born"; (2) noun "one of a pair of twins"; pl. ónoni "twins" (WJ:367)
	onónë see onórë
	onórë noun "sister" (of blood-kin) (THEL/THELES, NŌ; both of these entries in the Etymologies as reproduced in LR have the reading "onóne", but the "Old Noldorin" cognate wanúre listed in the entry THEL/THELES seems to indicate that the Quenya word should be onórë; the letters n and r are easily confused in Tolkien's handwriting. There is no clear evidence for a feminine ending -në in Quenya, but -rë is relatively well attested; cf. for instance ontarë.) – A later source gives the word for “sister” as nésa instead.
	onóro noun "brother" (of blood-kinship) (TOR, NŌ (WŌ) )
	onot- vb. "count up" (NOT). Compare not-.
	#onótië noun "reckoning" (isolated from Yénonótië *"reckoning of years", MR:51)
	Onótimo noun *"Reckoner" (the untranslated title of one Quennar, an expert of chronology) (MR:48-51)
	onta- (pa.t. ónë or ontanë) vb. "beget, create" (ONO, PE17:170)
	ontamo noun “mason (sculptor)” (PE17:107-108); this is a compound on(do) “stone” + tamo “smith”.
	ontani form cited in the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry ONO: supposedly the pl. of ontaro, ontarë noun "parent" (m. and. f.) Comparison with the singulars indicate that the n of ontani should actually be r. Thus ontani could be a misreading for ontari (SD:73), but according to VT46:7 the actual manuscript reading is ontaru, evidently a dual form referring to two parents.
	ontar noun prob. *"begetter, parent" (a gender-neutral term, applied to a woman in the source; compare the various gender-specific forms below) (VT44:7). Dual ontaru “(two) parents” (see ontani above).
	ontarë noun "begetter, parent" (fem); the pl. ontari or dual ontaru (see ontani) covers both sexes. (ONO, VT46:7)
	ontari noun "mother" or etymologically "begetter, parent" (fem.); clashing with the plural ontari "parents", this was apparently an emphemeral form (see ontarë, ontaril, ontarië for other feminine forms of "begetter, parent") (VT44:7)
	ontarië noun "begetter, parent" (fem.) (VT44:7)
	ontaril noun "mother", female *"begetter" (cf. onta-). Variant of ontarë. (VT43:32)
	ontaro noun "begetter, parent" (evidently masc.); pl. ontari or dual ontaru (see ontani) covers both sexes. (ONO, VT46:7)
	onwë noun “child” (PE17:170)
	onya noun *"my child", *"my son" (not the normal word for "son", however [cf. yondo] – onya seems to be derived from the stem ONO "beget") This may be a shortened form of *onnanya (see onna), like hinya "my child" (q.v.) is shortened from hinanya. It may be, then, that onya (like hinya) is only used in vocative. (UT:174)
	ópa noun “mouth”, in the sense of mouth-opening with lips as the edges (PE17:126)
	opelë noun "walled house or village, 'town' " (PEL(ES) )
	opo prep. “before, in front of” (of spatial relationships); "after" (of time), also pó, po or pono, poto (VT49:12, VT44:36, evidently a variant of apa). 
or prep. "over" (CO); in early "Qenya", this preposition was also defined as "on, upon" (LT1:256, MC:216). Prefixed or- is translated "up" in ortil, q.v.
#or- vb. "urge, impel, move", only of "mental" impulse. Constructed as an impersonal verb: orë nin caritas "I would like/feel moved to do so" (VT41:13), literally *"it impels for me to do so" (notice that what is the subject in English appears in the dative in Quenya). Elsewhere this verb is presented as an A-stem ora- instead (so that the aorist would be ora instead of orë, cf. ora nin "it warns me" in VT41:15), with past tense oranë or ornë, future tense oruv[a], present tense órëa and a form orië that may be the gerund; the forms orórië and ohórië were rejected but may have been intended as perfect forms (VT41:13, 18, VT49:54)
órava- vb. "have mercy", followed by locative: "have mercy on". Órava (o)messë "have mercy on us" (VT44:12) 
	orco ("k") noun "Orc", pl. orcor or orqui (WJ:390, ÓROK; pl. Orcor also in WJ:12, MR:74, 194). If the pl. form orqui is preferred, the word should be assigned the stem-form orcu-. Early "Qenya" has orc ("k") (orqu-) ("q") "monster, demon" (LT1:264; in LotR-style Quenya, no word can end in -rc.)
	orë (ori-) noun "grain" (QL:70)
	órë (1) noun "heart" (inner mind), also name of tengwa #21 (Appendix E), "premonition" (VT41:13), "nearest equivalent of 'heart' in our application to feelings, or emotions (courage, fear, hope, pity, etc.)" (VT41:13). The órë apparently defines a person's personality, cf. the description of Galadriel in PM:337, that "there dwelt in her the noble and generous spirit (órë) of the Vanyar". Órenya "my heart" (VT41:11).
	órë (2) noun "rising", anarórë "sunrise" (ORO). Cf. early "Qenya" órë "the dawn, Sunrise, East" (LT1:264). See under Melkor concerning the final element of Melkórë. 
	órëa adj. "of the dawn, Eastern" (LT1:264)
	óressë noun "in morning" (MC:214), evidently the locative of órë # 2 above.
	orma noun "physical matter" (MR:218, 231, 471)
	Ormal noun, one of the Lamps of the Valar: *"High-Gold"??? (Silm)
	ormë (1) noun "haste, violence, wrath", "rushing" (GOR, KHOR)
	ormë (2) noun "summit, crest" (LT1:256; this "Qenya" word is probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
	orna adj. (1) "hasty" (GOR)
	orna adj. (2) “tall, high, lofty” (PE17:112, 186), also orwa
	ornë noun "tree" (Letters:308, SD:302: "when smaller and more slender like a birch or rowan", Etym stem ÓR-NI: "tree, high isolated tree"). For the etymology, see Letters:426; for (original) difference in meaning between ornë and alda, see alda. In ornemalin "tree-yellow"; see laurelindórenan lindelorendor... (LotR2:III ch. 4; cf. Letters:308), also as final element in malinornë “yellow-tree, mallorn” (q.v.) Masc. name Ornendil *"Tree-friend" (Appendix A), compound Ornelië “tree-folk” (Quenya name of the Galadhrim, the tree-people of Lórien) (TI:239).
	ornemalin adj. “bearing yellow flowers” (PE17:80); this is Entish-style Quenya. See laurelindórenan lindelorendor…
	oro (1) noun “mount, mountain” (PE17:64), cf. Qenya oro noun "hill" (LT1:256; rather ambo in LotR-style Quenya, though #oro "mountain, hill" appears in Orocarni and orofarnë, q.v. [PE17:83], also with the meaning “high” in oromar, q.v.) Cf. oro- element “up, aloft” (PE17:64). 
	oro- (2) vb. "rise" (LT1:256; Tolkien's later Quenya has orta-, but cf. oro #1)
	Orocarni noun "the Red Mountains", place-name: literally rather *"Mountain-Reds": a plural form of carnë "red" with the element oro- "mountain" or "high" prefixed (Silm)
	orofarnë noun occurring in LotR2:III ch. 4, variously translated "mountain-dwelling" (Letters:224) and “mountain ash” (PE17:83)
	oromandin noun "wood-spirits" (MC:215; this is "Qenya")
	oromar (oromard-) noun "high (lofty) dwelling, ‘hall’“ (PM17:63-64), pl oromardi “high halls” or “high mansions” in Namárië (cf. RGEO:66, PE17:64), referring to the mansions of Manwë and Varda upon Mt. Taniquetil. See mar #1. Distinguish oromardi noun “mountain-dwellers” (PE16:96), pl. of *oromar(d-). 
	Oromë noun name of a Vala, adopted and adapted from Valarin. Observes Pengolodh, "the Eldar now take the name to singify 'horn-blowing' or 'horn-blower', but to the Valar it had no such meaning" (WJ:400-401, cf. SA:rom and ROM, TÁWAR in Etym, VT14:5). Genitive Oromëo and possessive Oroméva in WJ:368. .Loose compound Oromë róma “an Oromë horn”, sc. “one of Orome's horns (if he had more than one)” (WJ:368). A deleted entry in the Etymologies cited the name as Orómë with a long middle vowel (VT45:15). Oromendil, masc. name *"Friend of Oromë" (UT:210)
	Oromet noun place-name of obscure meaning (Silm)
	oron (oront-, as in pl. oronti) noun "mountain" (ÓROT; the root occurs in orotinga, q.v.) Oron Oiolossë "Mount Everwhite" (WJ:403)
	oronyë, pa.t. of orya-, q.v.
	oronta adj. "steep" (LT1:256)
	orontë, oronto noun "Sunrise" (LT1:264). Notice that in Tolkien’s later Quenya, orontë is also the intransitive pa.t. (“rose”) of the verb orta- “rise/raise” (q.v.)
	orosta noun "ascension" (LT1:256)
	orotinga noun "mountain-top" (VT47:28). Cf. ingor.
	orqui ("q") pl. of orco, q.v. (ÓROK, LT2:336)
	orro (also horro) "ugh, alas! ow!" (interjection "of horror, pain, disgust") (VT45:17)

	orróna adj. “eastern” (PE17:18)
	Orrostar place-name, the "Eastlands" of Númenor (UT:165)
	orta- vb. "rise”, also transitive “raise, lift up", pa.t. ortanë (Nam, RGEO:67, ORO; misreading "ortani" in Letters:426). According to PE17:63-64, this pa.t. form ortanë is only transitive (*”raised”), whereas the intransitive pa.t. (*”rose”) is orontë. Cf. orya-. 
	ortil (ortill-, pl. ortilli given) noun "up-point", term used in children's play for "finger", the counterpart of nútil, q.v. (VT47:10)
	#ortírië noun "patronage", isolated from ortírielyanna "to thy patronage" (VT44:7). A verbal stem #ortir- “over-watch” (look after, care for, protect) seems implied.
	orto noun "mountain-top" (ÓROT), “mount, mountain” (PE17:64)
	orto- vb. "raise" (LT1:256; in Tolkien's later Quenya orta-)
	orva noun "apple" (PE13:116)

	orya- vb. “rise” (intrasitive only, contrast orta-), pa.t. oronyë (PE17:64)
	os (ost-) noun "house, cottage" (LT2:336; hardly valid in LotR-style Quenya – writers may use coa or már)
	osamnar, noun a word for "diphthong" (actually plural "diphthongs", sg. #osamna?) which Tolkien in the late thirties (?) replaced by ocamna, q.v.
ósanwë noun "interchange of thought", "communication of thought", i.e. telepathy (VT39:23, PE17:183, cf. MR:415); Ósanwë-centa ("k") noun "Enquiry into the Communication of Thought" (VT39:23 cf. MR:415)
ósë “with him/her”; see ó-
osellë (þ) noun "sister, [female] associate" (THEL/THELES, WŌ). Cf. otorno.
	ossa noun "wall and moat" (LT2:336)
	ossë noun "terror" (GOS/GOTH). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, ossë was also the name of a Tengwa similar in shape to Roman c, which in a full-vowel mode apparently had the value o. (VT45:15; in the Sindarin "Mode of Beleriand", exemplified in the LotR itself, this letter has the value a instead. Elsewhere in the Etymologies itself, this symbol is called Elwë (q.v.) and is assigned the value e.)
	Ossë noun name of a Maia, adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:400), though connected with the common noun ossë "terror" in Etym (GOS/GOTH)

	osta (2) noun "homestead" (LT2:336)
	ostar noun "township" (LT2:336)
ostimë (pl. ostimi is attested) noun "blend", in linguistics a term for a kind of "strengthened" elements within a stem, where a single sound has been expanded into two different elements while maintaining a unitary effect and significance: such as s- being turned into st-, or m being strengthened to mb. (VT39:9)
ostirion noun “fort” (TI:423)
	osto (1) noun "a strong or fortified building or place, strong place, fortress" (MR:350, 471; WJ:414); "city, town with wall round" (OS, VT46:8)
	osto (2) noun "the gates of the Sun" (LT1:264; this "Qenya" word was probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
	Ostoher noun masc. name, *"City-lord" (Appendix A)
	oswë noun "hip" (QL:71). If this “Qenya” word is used in Tolkien’s later Quenya (and no other term for “hip” seems available), one would have to assume that the s represents older þ (or it would have become z > r). 
	otoquë cardinal "seventeen" (VT48:21)
	otornassë noun "brotherhood" (TOR)
	otorno noun "brother, sworn brother, [male] associate" (TOR, WŌ). Cf. osellë.
	otosta fraction "one seventh" (1/7). Also osta, otsat. (VT48:11)

	Otselen noun "Seven Stars" (otso + elen), a name of the Great Bear (constellation) (OT/OTOS/OTOK)
	otsat fraction "one seventh" (1/7). Also otosta, osta (VT48:11)
otso cardinal "seven" (SA:sîr, OT/OTOS/OTOK, VT48:6); otsëa ordinal "seventh" (VT42:25)
otsola noun "week" (evidently referring to a week of seven days like our own, since otso = seven). (GL:62). Compare enquië, the Eldarin six-day week, and lemnar, a five-day week.
ovéa adj. “(con)similar, alike”, also vávëa, q.v. (PE17:189)
	[ovesta] noun "contract, compact, treaty" (WED, WŌ)

<P>
pá, pa (1) prep. "on" with reference to contact of surfaces, especially vertical surface (in the sense in which a picture hangs on a wall); also used = "touching, as regards, concerning" (VT44:26). Another variant gives pá (and apa) with the meaning “on (above but touching)”. (2) Variants of apa "after" (VT44:36), which preposition is in one source also ascribed the first meaning here discussed. For Neo-Quenya purposes, pá and pa may be used for "on" or "concerning", whereas apa is used for "after" (see entries for apa #1 and #2), or pa may also be seen as a shorter form of apa “after”, as in the phrase yéni pa yéni *“years upon years” (VT44:36)
paca ("k") noun "paved floor, court" (GL:63)
pahta (1) adj. "closed, shut, private" (VT39:23, VT41:6, PE17:171)
pahta (2) noun “speech”, i.e. language (PE17:126); accompanied by the intransitive verb pakta- “speak, talk”, which would be *pahta- in Quenya, of which the transitive equivalent is quet-, q.v. The intransitive verb “speak” is also given as carpa-, q.v.
paimë noun "punishment" (QL:72)
paimeta- “exact or inflict a penalty; punish” (QL:72)
paimesta "chastisement" (QL:72)
paitya- vb. "repay, requite" (QL:72)
pal- (1) vb. “shake”, pa.t. pallë given (PE16:143).
[pal- (2) vb. "beat", also in an alternative (extended?) form palap-, VT46:8. See palpa-.]
 	palan adv.? “afar” (PE17:86), "far, distant, wide, to a great extent" (PAL), "wide, over a wide space, to a distance" (VT45:21), "far and wide" in palantír (pl. palantíri) "Far-gazer", the magical far-seeing stones made by the Noldor in the First Age (SA:palan, PAL, PE17:86). For etymology, see Letters:427. The spelling “pálan-tìr” in PE17:86 may seem to indicate an unusual stress pattern with primary stress on the initial syllable and a secondary stress on the final one (normally a Quenya word of this shape would be stressed on ant); it is unclear if this source describes the Quenya accents or some older pattern. – Also Palantir masc. name, "Far-sighted" (Appendix A, SA:palan, PAL, TIR); assimilated palar- in Palarran "Far-Wanderer", name of a ship (palan + ran) (UT:179)
	palantír noun *"Far-seer", used = "Seeing Stone" (pl. palantíri is attested); see palan-. The form palantir (with a short i) appears in Letters:110.
	[palap-, see palpa-]
	palar noun "flat field, 'wang', plain" (the editors indicate that the last gloss may also be read as "place", but "plain" seems more likely in light of the other glosses, VT46:8)
	Palarran ship-name “Far-wanderer”; see palan
	palis noun "sward, lawn" (LT1:264)
	palla adj. "wide, expansive" (PAL)
	palmë noun "surface" (PAL)
	palpa- vb. "to beat, batter" (PALAP). The alternative form pal-, evidently with an extended form palap-, was struck out by Tolkien (VT46:8)
	palta (1) noun "the flat of the hand, the hand held upwards or forwards, flat and tensed" (with fingers and thumb closed or spread) (VT47:8, 9)
	palta- (2) vb. "feel with the hand, stroke" etc. (basic meaning: "pass the sensitive palm [palta] over a surface") (VT47:9)
	palu- vb. "open wide, spread, expand, extend" (PAL). Compare palu- intransitive “swell”, pa.t. púlë, in Tolkien's early material (QL:75)
	palúrë noun "surface, bosom, bosom of Earth" (= Old English folde) (PAL); cf. Palúrien.
	Palúrien noun, surname of Yavanna (PAL)
	Palurin place-name "the wide world" (LT1:264)
	palya- vb. "open wide, spread, expand, extend" (PAL)
	pan adv. “since” (in the sense of because) (VT49:17, 18). The word comes from a text that was later struck out; we cannot know whether Tolkien rejected the word as such.
	panda noun "enclosure" (PAD)
	pano (1) noun "piece of shaped wood" (PAN)
	pano (2) noun “plan, arrangement” (QL:72)
	panta adj. "open" (PAT)

	pantië noun "unfolding, opening, revealing" (abstract formation or gerund formed from panta "open", adjective and noun) (QL:72)
	panya- vb. "fix, set" (PAN). The verb napan- (q.v.), “add” or literally *”to-set”, may argue the existence of a shorter stem #pan- as well.
	paptalasselindeën inflected noun "like music of falling leaves" (MC:216; this is "Qenya")
	#par- vb. “learn” (acquire information, not by experience or observation, but by communication, by the instruction, or by written accounts, of others). Paranyë (apárien) parmanen, “I am learning (have learnt) by means of a book” (PE17:180). – It may be that Tolkien at some point intended the root par- to mean “write”, cf. loiparë. 
	parca (1) ("k") adj. "dry" (PÁRAK)
	parca (2) (“k”) adj. “naked”, of persons (PE17:86)
	parma noun "book", also name of tengwa #2 (PAR, Appendix E). In early "Qenya", the gloss was "skin, bark, parchment, book, writings" (LT2:346); Tolkien later revisited the idea that parma basically is a noun “peel” and refers to bark or skin (as primitive writing materials, PE17:86): “’peel’, applied to bark or skin, hence “book”, ‘bark (literally skinning, peeling off), parchment, book’; ‘a book (or written document of some size”)’” (PE17:123). In the meantimeTolkien had associated the word with a root PAR meaning “compose, put together” (LR:380); the word loiparë “mistake in writing” (q.v.) may also suggest that the root PAR at one point was to mean “write”, so that a parma was a *“written thing”. – Instrumental form parmanen “with a book” or “by means of a book” (PE17:91, 180), parmastanna “on your book” (with the endings -sta dual “your”, -nna allative) (VT49:47), parmahentië noun “book reading” (PE17:77). Other compounds: parmalambë noun "book-language" = Q[u]enya (PAR), #parma-resta noun *“book-fair”, attested with the endings -lya “thy” and the allative ending -nna (parma-restalyanna *”upon your book-fair”) (VT49:38, 39). Parma as the name of the tengwa letter for P occurs compunded in parmatéma noun "p-series", labials, the second column of the Tengwar system (Appendix E). 
	parna adj. “bare” (PE17:86), also with variant form parnë (PE17:171)
	passa adj. “smooth, glabrous” (PE17:171)
	pasta- vb. “to smooth, iron” (PE17:171)
	pasta (2) adj. "smooth" (PATH), variant of passa
	pata- vb. “walk” (PE17:34)
#pataca noun "consonant" (only pl. patacar ["k"] is attested) (VT39:8)
páva noun "mouth" (including tongue, lips and teeth). Apparently changed by Tolkien to náva, q.v. (VT39:19)
pávatengwi, pávëar, words Tolkien apperently changed to návatengwi, návëar (q.v.) (VT39:19)
	pé noun "lip", dual peu "the two lips, the mouth-opening" (VT39:9; VT47:12, 35). In an earlier source, the Etymologies, pé was glossed "mouth" (PEG), whereas in PE17:126 it is more specifically “the closed mouth”.
	pëanta- vb. “give instructions to” (QL:72)
	pel- vb. "go round, revolve, return" (PEL), apparently also transitive “encircle” (mentioned in the Silmarillion Appendix as a meaning of the root), cf. also “Qenya” pele- “surround, fence in, pen in” (pa.t. pellë given, QL:73)
	pelecco ("k") noun "axe" (LT2:346)
	pelecta- ("k") vb. "hew" (this "Qenya" word may be adapted to LotR-style Quenya as *pelehta-) (LT2:346)
	*pelehta- see pelecta- 
	Pelendur masc.name, *"Fence-servant"??? (Appendix A)
	peler noun "fenced field" (Old English tún) (PEL(ES) )
	pella "beyond", apparently a postposition rather than a preposition: Andúnë pella "beyond the West", elenillor pella "from beyond the stars" (Nam, RGEO:66, Markirya) In one version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer, Tolkien used pell' (evidently an elided form of pella) as a preposition, but this version was abandoned (VT43:13)
	pelo noun “a boundary (fence)” (PE17:92)
Pelóri place-name "Fencing Heights", the mountains raised by the Valar to protect Aman (SA:pel, WJ:403)
	peltas (peltax-, as in pl. peltaxi ["ks"]) noun "pivot" (PEL, TAK)
#pempë noun ”lip” (attested only in pl. pempi, PE17:126); cf. pé.
[pen prep. “without, not having” (PE17:171). Cf. Ú #1.]
pen- vb. negative of #sam- “to have” (q.v.), used as a negative answer to inquires on ownership: penin “no / I haven't” (PE17:173)       
	penda adj. "sloping down, inclined" (PEN/PÉNED), “steeply inclined, sloping down” (PE17:24)
	penda- vb. “slope, incline” (PE17:171, 173)
	pendë noun "slope, downslope, declivity" (PEN/PÉNED), “steep incline, hill side” (PE17:24)
penga- vb. "pout" (VT39:11)
#penna noun "vowel" (only pl. pennar is attested) (VT39:16)
penquanta ("peñ"-) adj. "full to the brim, with mouth full" (VT39:11)
pentë, see #pet-
penya adj. "lacking, inadequate"; pl. penyë in penyë tengwi "lacking signs", "inadequate signs"; in early Elvish analysis of Quenya the term for vowels with no preceding consonant, held (in many cases incorrectly) to have lost such a consonant (VT39:6, 8)
	Pereldar pl. noun "Half-elven" (= Sindarin Peredhil) (Letters:282), in the Etymologies used of the Danas or Nandor (PER). Sg. #Perelda.
	peresta fraction "one half" (1/2), also perta (VT48:11)
#Perian noun "Hobbit" (#Periand-), gen. pl. Periandion *"of Hobbits" in the Elaine inscription. VT49:40 gives the erroneous reading Periondion.
	perina adj.? *"divided in middle, halved" (PER) The word is not glossed, but seems to connect with the verb perya- "halve". If the relationship is the same as between the verb lerya- "to free" and the adj. lerina "free", then perina is most likely an adjective "halved"d.
	perper- vb, “suffer great anguish”, “endure to end”, pa.t. perpérë (QL:73)
	perta fraction "one half" (1/2), also peresta (VT48:11)
	perya- vb. "divide in middle, halve" (PER)
	#pet- vb. "knock, strike" (cited as "pete", perhaps with a suffixed stem-vowel); pa.t. pentë given. (QL:73)
peu dual noun "the two lips, the mouth-opening" (VT39:9); the dual of pé, q.v.
phin- noun “a single hair, filament” (PE17:17); this is may be seen as an “element” rather than a regular word; the spelling ph rather than f is unusual for Quenya. See fine. 
phindelë noun “mass of long hair” (PE17:17; the normal Quenya spelling should be findelë, cf. findilë
pia adj. “little” (PE17:115); variants picina (“k”), pincë (“k”), pitya
pí noun "small insect, fly" (VT47:35)
	pica (1) ("k") noun "small spot, dot" (PIK)
	píca- (2) ("k") vb. "lessen, dwindle, waning"; participle pícala "waning" (with locative ending: pícalassë) in Markirya
	pícë ("k") prep.? "upon" (???) (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	picina, see pia
	Picinaucor ("k") pl. noun "Petty-dwarves" (sg. #Picinauco, cf. nauco). Also Pitya-naucor (WJ:389). A distinct term nuxo is listed in PE17:45.
	pië noun “berry” (PE16:143)
	#pil- “steal” (cited in form “pili-”, apparently the aorist stem), pa.t. píle (QL:74)%
	pilin (pilind-, as in pl. pilindi) noun "arrow" (PÍLIM)
	pilinehtar noun unidentified plant, some kind of rush, or rush in general (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator  p. 199, note 34)
	piliningevë ??? (Narqelion)
	pilu noun "thief, robber" (QL:73)
	pilwë noun “robbery, theft” (QL:73)
	*pimpë noun “tail”. A possible adaptation of the word pint, pimp- from Tolkien’s early “Qenya” (QL:74), if the word is to be used in the context of LotR-style Quenya.
	pinilya adj. "small" (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
	pincë (“k”), see pia
	pinquë ("q") ??? (Nabrqelion)
	pior ??? (Narqelion)
	pir- "spin, turn" (apparently intransitive). Actually cited in the form piri-, perhaps with the connecting vowel of the aorist included. "Qenya" pa.t. pírë. (QL:74)
	pirnë, variant of pirindë, q.v. 
	pirë noun “toe”, dual piru (PE16:96). Compare taltil.
	pirindë noun “a flower that opened and shut quickly with any change of light at [?some ?not] even a pansy closed” (PE17:146; reading uncertain and meaning obscure; read perhaps “…at [which] not even a pansy closed”) Also pirnë.
pirucendëa adj. “on the points of her toes” (PE16:96); see pirë, cendë. In earlier “Qenya”, the word had a wholly different meaning: adj. "whirling lightly" (MC:215). Compare pirucenda ("k") "pirouetting" in QL:74.
	pirya noun "juice, syrup" (PIS)
	#pitya adj. "little" in Pityafinwë, Pitya-naucor
	Pityafinwë masc. name "Little Finwë"; he was called Amrod in Sindarin. Short Quenya name Pityo (PM:353)
	Pitya-naucor pl. noun "Petty-dwarves" (sg. #Pitya-nauco, cf. nauco) Also Picinaucor (WJ:389) 
	Pityo see Pityafinwë
piucca noun "blackberry" (PE16:143)
	piuta vb.? and noun? "spit" (PIW)
	po, pó prep. “before, in front of” (of spatial relationships) "after" (of time), also opo or pono, poto- (VT49:12, 32, VT44:36; evidently a variant of apa)
poa noun "beard" (GL:63). Rather fanga in Tolkien's later Quenya
	poica ("k") adj. "clean, pure" (POY)
	poita- vb. "cleanse", pa.t. poinë (QL:75, VT48:13)
	pol- (1) vb. "can" = have physical power and ability, as in polin quetë "I can speak (because mouth and tongue are free)". Cf. ista-, lerta- as verbs "can" with somewhat different shades of meaning. (VT41:6, PE17:181)
	pol (2) adj. “large, big (strong)”. Since this would be the sole example of a monosyllabic Quenya adjective, it may be that Tolkien is here citing the root POL rather than a complete word. Cf. polda. 
	polca ("k") noun "pig" (QL:75)
	polda adj. “big” (PE17:115), "strong, burly" (POL/POLOD)
	poldorë noun? (not glossed, derived from polda "strong, burly": possibly "strength" as an abstract) (POL/POLOD)
Poldor, Poldomo noun “breaker up of the hard / tough”, Poldor- “land-breaker?”, variant forms of Poldórëa, q.v., introduced at a time when Tolkien did not want the root POL to refer to strength or mightiness (PE17:181), cf. polda from an earlier source.
	Poldórëa adj. "Valiant"; as title of Tulkas replaced by Astaldo (POL/POLOD, MR:146, 149. In GL:64, poldórëa is glossed "mighty", in QL:75, "muscular".)
	[polë (stem poli-) noun ”meal, grist” (PE17:115, 181), a word Tolkien decided to replace by mulë; perhaps polë was a variant of porë.]
	pono, see po, pó
	póna adv. “forward” (VT49:12), also ompa
	pontë (ponti-) noun "back, rear" (QL:75)
	porë (stem *pori-, given the primitive form ¤pori) noun "flour, meal" (POR). See polë.
            porocë ("k") noun “hen; barn fowl” (PE16:132)
	pota-, see po, pó
	potai adv. “therefore”. Tolkien seems uncertain whether to use this form or etta (VT49:12). Cf. also epetai.
	puhta noun "coitus" (PE13:163, gloss specified to refer to "one act"; a more general word for "sex" could perhaps be derived by adding an abstract or generalizing ending like -lë)
	punta noun "stopped consonant" (PUT, see PUS; according to VT46:33, this does not refer to a "stop" or plosive consonant, but to a letter with a subscript dot indicating that it is not followed by a vowel. Compare putta.)
	púrëa adj. "smeared, discoloured" (Markirya)
	pusta (1) noun "stop", in punctuation full stop (PUS). Compare putta.
	pusta- (2) vb. "to stop, put a stop to"; also intr. "cease, stop" (PUS)
	pustanë participle? "blowing" (MC:213; this is "Qenya") 
	putta noun "stop" (in punctuation) (PUT; see PUS). According to VT46:10, a dot under a letter is intended, possibly indicating that the consonant is not followed by a vowel; cf. VT46:33 and see VT49:38, 40 regarding an actual example of such punctuation in a Tengwar sample.

<Q> 
	quácë ("k") noun "frog"; this replaced coacë ("koake"), a form rejected by Tolkien (VT47:36)
	quáco ("q") noun "crow" (WJ:395; Etym also has corco, q.v.)
quain cardinal "ten" (also quëan); quainëa ordinal "tenth" (VT48:6, 20; VT42:25). Quain or quëan replaced the form cainen in Tolkien’s conception.
	quainë ("q") adj.? or participle? "wailing (pl.)" (MC:213; this is "Qenya")
	quaican, cardinal "fourteen" (but *canaquë may be preferred) (VT48:21)
	quailepen, cardinal "fifteen" (but lepenquë may be preferred) (VT48:21) 
	quainel, cardinal "thirteen" (but yunquentë may be preferred) (VT48:21)
	quainquë, cardinal "sixteen" (but enenquë may be preferred) (VT48:21)
	*quaista, reconstructed/updated fraction "one tenth"; see caista. 
	qual- vb. “to die”, pa.t. quallë (PE16:143)
qualin ("q") adj. "dead" (KWAL, LT1:264)
	qualmë ("q") noun "agony, death" (KWAL, LT1:264)
	qualumë ("q") participle? "heaving" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	quama- (“q”) verb “vomit; be sick”, pa.t. quámë (QL:76)
	quámë ("q") noun "sickness" (KWAM), “sickness, nausea” (QL:76). Earlier material also gives quámë as the past tense of the related verb quama- “vomit, be sick”.
	quámëa (“q”) adj. “sick” (evidently = nauseous, cf. quámë and the verb quama-) (QL:76)
	quanda ("q") adj: i quanda "all the, the whole" (apparently to be followed by a noun). The article i should perhaps not be included when the following noun is already determined by being a proper name (*quanda Endor "the whole [of] Middle-earth") or a pronominal suffix (*quanda hroanya, "my whole body"), though we cannot be certain. (QL:70)
	quanta (1) ("q") adj. "full" (KWAT, Narqelion, VT39:8, VT43:28), “filled, full” (PE17:68); the gloss “filled” would suggest that quanta can be regarded as a passive participle of quat- (q.v.) In these phrases: quanta sarmë "full writing", writing with separate letters for vowels (VT39:8); #quanta tengwë "full sign" (only pl. quantë tengwi is attested), in early Elvish analysis of Quenya the term for a consonant + a vowel (then analyzed as a kind of unitary phoneme rather than two phonemes); hence a stem like mata- "eat" was analyzed as two quantë tengwi, namely ma + ta. (VT39:5)
	quanta- (2) vb. “fill” (PE17:68), cf. enquantuva “will refill” in Namárië. This verb seems to spring from a secondary use of the adjective quanta “full” as a verbal stem, whereas the synonym quat- (q.v.) is the original primary verb representing the basic root KWAT.
	Quantarië noun "Day of Completion, Oldyear's Day" (PM:127) (= the quantien of the Etymologies)
	quanta emma, quantemma noun “facsimile”, a complete detailed visual reproduction (by any means) of a visible thing” (PE17:179), literally *”full picture”, cf. emma, q.v.
	quantien ("q") noun "last day of year" (YEN) or "full year" (VT46:23). The latter gloss also turns up in PM: quantien  "full year" = yén, a period of 144 solar years (PM:126; pl. quantiéni, PM:127). Since the latter meaning comes from drafts for the LotR Appendices that did not make it into the published LotR, it is difficult to tell whether it is canonical.
	quapta- vb. “exchange” (QL:76); quaptalë noun “exchange”
	quárë (also quár) noun "fist" (SA:celeb, KWAR; in the Etymologies, Tolkien first wrote quár pl. quari, and quár is also found in PM:318 and VT47:8, in the latter case changed from quárë, VT47:22. As usual, the spelling of the Etym forms shows q instead of qu.) According to PM:318 and VT47:8, the "chief use [of this word] was in reference to the tightly closed hand as in using an implement or a craft-tool rather than to the 'fist' as used in punching".
	quárelë noun “watchfulness, anxiety” (QL:76)%
	quat- vb. "fill" (WJ:392), future #quantuva "shall fill" (enquantuva "shall refill") (Nam, RGEO:67) Irrespective of the prefix en- "re", the form enquatuva (VT48:11) displays the expected future tense of quat-. The Namárië form enquantuva seems to include a nasal infix as well, which is possibly an optional feature of the future tense. On the other hand, PE17:68 cites the verb as quanta- rather than quat-, and then the future-tense form quantuva would be straightforward.
	quëa noun “vegetable”, apparently with variant ceula (latter word is not clearly defined). (PE17:159).
quëan cardinal "ten", also quain (VT48:6, 12, 20). Quain or quëan replaced the form cainen in Tolkien’s conception.
	#quel- ("q") vb. "to fail" (wane, wither, fade; compare the nouns quelië “waning”, quellë “fading”), only attested in the future tense (queluva in FS).
	quelet ("q") (quelets-, as in pl. queletsi) noun "corpse" (KWEL; Markirya also has loico)
	quelië noun "waning" in Narquelië, q.v. 
	quellë noun "fading", in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 54 days, but also used without any exact definition, for the latter part of autumn and the beginning of winter (Appendix D)
	quén (quen-, as in pl. queni; as final element in compounds -quen) noun "one, (some)body, person, individual, man or woman", pl. queni = "persons", "(some) people", "they" with the most general meaning (as in "they [= people in general] say that..."). The element is combined with noun and adjective stems in old compounds to denote habitual occupations or functions, or to describe those having some notable (permanent) quality; examples include roquen, ciryaquen, arquen, q.v. Also in aiquen “whoever”, ilquen “everybody” (WJ:361 cf. 360, 372).
	quendë noun "Elf", the little-used analogical sg. of Quendi, q.v. (KWEN(ED), WJ:361)
	Quendelië ("q") noun *"the People of the Elves" (KWEN(ED) )
	Quendendil (also contracted Quendil; pl. Quendili in WJ:410) masc. name "Elf-friend" (WJ:410)
	Quenderin adj. "Quendian, belonging to the Elves as a whole" (a learned word) (WJ:407). The phrase quenderinwë coar “Elvish bodies” (PE17:175) presupposes a longer form *quenderinwa, here attested in the pl.
	Quendi noun "Elves" as a race (analogical sg. quendë, not much used) (WJ:361; SA:quen-/quet-, WJ:372, KWEN(ED), spelt "qende, Qendi" in Etym). Gen. pl. Quendion (PM:395)
	quendi noun "Elvish woman", pl. quendir given (MR:229; changed by Tolkien from quendë pl. quender); the sg. quendi must not be confused with the pl. Quendi, see above. Compare masc. quendu.
	Quendingoldo masc. name, apparently compound of Quendi "Elves" and -ngoldo "Noldo", Sindarin Pengolodh, a loremaster of Gondolin. (PM:401, 404-405, VT48:5) Shorter form Quengoldo (PM:404, VT48:14)
	quendu noun *"Elvish man", pl. quendur given (MR:229; changed by Tolkien from quendo pl. quendor). Compare fem. quendi.
	Quendya original form of the word Quenya, preserved in the Vanyarin dialect (Quenya is the Noldorin form) (WJ:361, 371)
	quent ("q") noun "word" (LT2:348; in Tolkien's later Quenya quetta)
	quenta ("q") noun "tale" (KWET), "narrative, story" (VT39:16); Quenta Silmarillion "the Story/Tale of the Silmarils", also Quenta Eldalien “History of the Elves” (SD:303), notice “Qenya” genitive in -n in the latter title. Quenta is also translated "account", as in Valaquenta "Account of the Valar".
	quentalë ("q") noun "account, history" (KWET), "narration, History" as abstract, but the word may also be used with a particular reference, as in quentalë Noldoron or quentalë Noldorinwa "the history of the Noldor", referring to the real events rather than an account of them: "that part of [universal] History which concerned the Noldor". (VT39:16; in this source the spelling really is "quentale" rather than "qentale")
	quentaro ("q") noun "narrator" (KWET)
quentasta noun *"historical account", "any particular arrangement (by some author) of a series of records or evidences into a given historical account" (not History as such, which is quentalë). (VT39:16, VT48:19). May include the "group suffix" -asta.
	quentelë ("q") noun "sentence" (LT2:348)
	quenya noun (original adj.) "speech" (PM:399); the language-name Quenya is said to mean properly "language, speech" (WJ:393); cf. the phrase coirëa quenya "living speech" (PM:399). However, Quenya (archaic Quendya, still so in Vanyarin) is also interpreted "Elvish" (Letters:176), sc. the adjective corresponding to Quendi (WJ:374), but it was no longer used as a general adjective. Quenya lambë "Quenya tongue" (WJ:407). The command queta Quenya! “speak Quenya!” was used in the sense of “speak precisely and intelligibly, put into actual words” (instead of using hand signs or looks); the word Quenya is here used adverbially (PE17:138). The variant queta quenyā (PE17:137) appears to use the distinct accusative (formed by lengthening a final vowel) known from ”Book Quenya”.
	#quer- vb. “turn” (transitive), attested as pa.t. quernë (VT49:18-20). Compare kuere (kwere) as one variant of a stem meaning “turn” (PE14:65). English intransitive “to turn” requires a reflexive pronoun in Quenya: mo quernë immo *“one turned oneself” (VT49:6), in idiomatic English simply “one turned”. Passive participle #querna “turned”, isolated from nuquerna (q.v.) *"under-turned" = reversed, turned upside down. Also in númenquerna *“turned westward” (VT49:18), nanquernë *“turned back”, pl. form of *nanquerna (VT49:17-18, 20)
	#queren noun “pivot” (PE17:65), only cited as a stem-form querend-. (Cf. peltas.) It is unclear whether Tolkien rejected this word or not.
	querma noun “spinning wheel, turn-table” (PE17:65). It is unclear whether Tolkien rejected this word or not.
	quessë noun "feather", also name of tengwa #4 (Appendix E, WJ:417, KWES, VT45:24); súriquessë "wind feather" (referring to a "tuft of radiating grass" in a drawing by Tolkien) (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator, p. 197)
	quesset ("q") noun "pillow"; probably *quessec- since the Sindarin (or "Noldorin") cognate pesseg points to a primitive form *kwessek- (compare filit, filic-) (KWES)
quessetéma noun "qu-series", velarized series: fourth column of the Tengwar system (Appendix E)
	quet- vb. "say, speak" (SA:quen-/quet-, LT2:348), sg. aorist quetë in VT41:11 and VT49:19 (spelt “qete” in the latter source), not to be confused with the infinitival aorist stem in the example polin quetë “I can speak” (VT41:6); pl. aorist quetir in VT49:10-11, present tense quéta in VT41:13, pa.t. quentë in PM:401, 404, apparent gerund quetië in VT49:28 (by Tolkien translated as “words”, but more literally evidently *”speaking”). Imperative in the command queta Quenya! “speak Quenya!” (PE17:138), see Quenya regarding the meaning of this phrase. The same verb is translated "tell" in the sentence órenya quetë nin "my heart tells me" (VT41:15). Cf. also #maquet- 
	quetil ("q") noun "tongue, language" (KWET)
quetta noun "word" (SA:quen-/quet-, GL:28), pl. quettar (WJ:391). An quetta “a word more” (phrase used = “to add to what has been said”) (PE17:91)
qui conj. “if” (VT49:19)
quië adv. “whenever”. Also quiquië. (VT49:23, 35)
	quilda adj. “quiet, hushed, still” (QL:78)
quildë, quillë noun "quiet, rest, hush" (GL:23, QL:78)
quilë noun “hue, colour” (QL.77)
quilta noun "girdle, belt" (QL:78); the same source also lists a verb qilti- (sic) “gird, encircle”; one could perhaps read *quilta- if this verb were to be adapted to Tolkien’s later Quenya. 
	químari ("q") noun in pl. "phantoms" (MC:213; in LotR-style Quenya rather fairi, sg. fairë)
quimellë noun "lady" (GL:45)
quín, quínë noun “crest, ridge” (PE17:24. 173)
quinna adj. “crested” (PE17:24, 173)
quindë pa.t. of quir-, q.v.
	quinga ("q") noun "bow" (for shooting) (KWIG, LT1:256) 
	quingi ("q") noun "twang, of strings, harp" (LT1:256; rather tingë, tango in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	quiquië adv. “whenever”. Also quië. (VT49:23, 35, 36)
	quín, quínë noun “crest, ridge” (PE17:24)
	quinna adj. “crested” (PE17:24)
	#quir- vb. "stir" or make spin (actually cited as quiri-, perhaps with the connecting vowel of the aorist included); pa.t. quindë (QL:77)
	quorin ("q") adj. "drowned, choked" (LT1:264) Some will reject this as a valid word in LotR-style Quenya, since quo- may not be a possible combination in this later version of the High-Elven language.
	quoro- ("q") vb. "choke, suffocate" (LT1:264; verbal stems ending in -o are not known from Tolkien's later Quenya; read *quor-?) See quorin.

<R>
	-r nominative plural ending regularly used on nouns ending in -a, -i, -ië, -o, -u, e.g. Ainur, Valar, tier. Occasionally it is added also to nouns ending in -ë (that normally take the ending -I in the pl.). This seems to regularly happen in the case of nouns in -lë (see #fintalë, mallë, tyellë), sometimes also otherwise (see Ingwë, wendë, essë #1). This plural ending was ("it is said") first used by the Noldor (PM:402).
	-r plural ending used on verbs with a plural subject (VT49:48, 50, 51), e.g. lantar “fall” in Namárië (with the plural subject lassi “leaves”), or unduláver as the pl. form of undulávë “licked down, covered” (PE17:72). The ending is sometimes missing where we might expect it; for instance, the verb tarnë “stood” has multiple subjects and yet does not appear as *tarner in PE17:71.
	rá (1) [changed by Tolkien from hrá], prep. "on behalf of", followed by dative: rá men or contracted rámen "for us, on our behalf" (VT43:27, 28, 33). As these examples indicate, independent dative pronouns may be (but do not have to be) directly suffixed to rá. Nouns would presumably not be suffixed like this, e.g. *rá Eldan "for an Elf, on behalf of an Elf".
	rá (2) noun "lion", stem #ráv- as in the pl. rávi (RAW). Compare rau.
	rá (3) noun "arm" (LT2:335, there spelt râ; probably obsoleted by # 2 (and # 1) above. In Tolkien's later Quenya, "arm" is ranco)
	rac- ("k") vb. "break", past participle rácina ("k") "broken" in Markirya
#racina adj. "stripped, deprived"; this adj. is only attested in the pl. (racinë ["k"]). Compare rácina under rac- above. Cf. #racina tengwë (only pl. racinë tengwi ("k") is attested) "stripped sign", "deprived sign"; in early Elvish analysis of Quenya the term for a consonant with no following vowel; the vowel was held to have disappeared or been omitted (VT39:6)
	ráca ("k") noun "wolf" (DARÁK). Another word for “wolf” is narmo.
	racta- ("k") vb. "stretch out, reach" (LT2:335; read *rahta- if the word is to be adapted to LotR-style Quenya)
	*rahta- see racta-
	raica ("k") adj. "crooked, bent, wrong" (RÁYAK, VT39:7), pl. raicar in LR:47 (read perhaps *raicë in LotR-style Quenya)
raima noun "net" (VT42:12)
raimë noun "network, lace" (VT42:28). – In the Etymologies as printed in LR, a word raimë "hunt, hunting" is also cited in the entry ROY1, but this is a misreading for roimë in Tolkien's manuscript (VT46:12)
raina (1) adj. "nettled, enlaced" (VT42:11)
raina (2) adj. "smiling, gracious, sweet-faced" (VT44:35, PE17:182). Cf. raita #3.
rainë noun "peace" (VT44:34-35)
raita- 1) vb. "make network or lace" (also rëa-) (VT42:12)
raita- 2) vb. "catch in a net" (VT42:12)
raita- 3) vb. “smile”, pa.t. rëantë (PE17:182)
[raiwe noun "lace" (VT42:12)]
	ráma noun "wing", pl. rámar (RAM, Nam, RGEO:66, LT2:335); Markirya has both nominative pl. rámar "wings" and instrumental pl. rámainen *"with wings" (translated "on wings" by Tolkien); rámali "wings" in MC:213 would be a partitive pl. in LotR-style Quenya. Variant rámë in the names Eärrámë, Alquarámë, q.v.
	rama- vb. "to shout" (LT1:259)
	rámalócë ("k") noun "winged dragon" (LOK)
	rámavoitë adj. "having wings" (LT2:335, Narqelion)
	ramba noun "wall" (RAM, SA, VT46:10)
	rambë noun "a shout" (LT1:259)
	rámen, see rá
	ran (ram-) noun "noise" (LT1:259, QL:79)
Rána place-name "the Wayward, the Wanderer", a name of the moon (MR:198, MC:221, Silm); genitive Ráno in the phrase Ráno tië "the path of the Moon" (VT47:11). See also ceuran-, ránasta. According to one late source, Rána is not properly the Moon itself but is rather the "name of the spirit (Máya) that was said to abide in the Moon as its guardian" (VT42:13). The Etymologies gives Rana with a short vowel (RAN). In the pre-classical Tengwar system there presupposed, Rana was also the name of tengwa #25 (VT45:10), which letter Tolkien would later call Rómen instead. 
ránasta noun "lunar month" (Rána + asta, q.v.) (VT48:11)
	ranco ("k") noun "arm", stem *rancu- given the primitive form ¤ranku, hence also pl. ranqui ("q") (RAK)
	randa noun "cycle, age" (100 Valian Years) (RAD, cf. LR:171: “an age, which is 100 years of the Valar”). A Valian year is equated with ten of “our” years (LR:171), making a randa the equivalent of 1,000 solar years (but possibly the word can also be used for “age” in general).
	ránë noun "straying, wandering" (RAN)
	ránen adj. "errant" (RAN; may be a misreading for *ránëa)
	ranga (pl. rangar is attested) noun "yard, full pace". This Númenórean linar measure was "slightly longer than our yard, approximately 38 inches [= 96.5 cm]". (UT:285, 461)
	rangwë noun "fathom" (RAK)
	ranqui ("q") pl. of ranco (RAK)
	#ranta noun "part”. Pl. rantali attested. (PE14:117)
ranya- (1) vb. "to stray" (RAN), (2) ranya noun "erratic wandering" (VT42:13), (3) ranya, also aranya, adj. "free". Another gloss was not certainly legible, but the editors suggest "uncontrolling" (VT46:10)
	Rása noun "the Sea" (LT2:347; rather ëar in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	rasco, see rassë
	rassë, also rasco, noun "horn" (especially on living animal, but also applied to mountains) (RAS/VT46:10, PM:69)
	#rasta cardinal "twelve" (isolated from yurasta "24", two times 12; cf. the stem RÁSAT "twelve" listed in the Etymologies). See yunquë. (PE14:17)
	ráta- vb. “excel, surpass” (PE17:147)
	rato adv. "soon" (Arct)
	rau (pl. rávi) noun "lion" (LT1:260; the pl. of this "Qenya" form is valid in Tolkien's later Quenya as well, but the sg. he changed to rá, q.v.)
rauca (“k”) noun “demon” (PE17:48). Variant of rauco, q.v.
	rauco ("k") noun "a powerful, hostile, and terrible creature", "very terrible creature", especially in the compound Valarauco noun "Demon of Might" (WJ:415, VT39:10, cf. SA:raukor. In the Etymologies, stem RUK, the gloss is "demon".) Longer variant arauco. The plural form Valaraucar "Balrogs" seems to contain the variant rauca. 
	raumo noun "(noise of a) storm" (Markirya)
	raust noun "hunting, preying" (LT1:260; in LotR-style Quenya rather roimë [misreading "raime" in LR:384]. Normally, LotR-style Quenya does not permit final consonant clusters.)
	rauta noun "metal" [meaning changed by Tolkien from "copper"]. Notice that in the LotR, the word for metal is given as tinco. (RAUTĀ)
	rauta- vb. "to hunt" (LT1:260; in Tolkien's later Quenya rather roita-)
	?ravanda noun?, a form cited by Tolkien to elucidate the Noldorin word rhofan "wilderness"; it is not clear whether ravanda is meant as a Quenya cognate or just as an etymological (Old Noldorin?) form (VT46:10)
	ráva (1) adj. “free, unfettered, uncontrolled, lawless” (PE17:78), "wild, untamed" (RAB). In PE17:78, the gloss “wild” is given to the variant hráva instead.
	ráva (2) noun "bank" (especially of a river) (RAMBĀ)
	rávë noun "roaring noise" (Markirya)
	rávëa adj. "roaring" (Markirya)
	ravennë noun "she-lion" (LT1:260)
	raxa noun “a drag of any large, flat vehicle on wheels or rollers for hauling stone or other weighty material” (PE17:28)
	#raxë noun "danger" (pl. ablative raxellor, VT44:9); Tolkien also considered the form #raxalë (pl. ablative raxalellor) (ibid.)
	[re, possibly a 3rd person singular emphatic pronoun, struck out by Tolkien (VT49:49)]
	ré noun "day" (of the sun), a full 24-hour cycle (Appendix D) composed of aurë (day, daylight) and lómë “night” (VT49:45). Short -rë in compounds like Ringarë (q.v.). Allative rénna (VT49:45).
rëa- vb. "make network; make lace" (VT42:12)
rehtië noun “rescue, saving” (seemingly the gerund of a verb *rehta- “rescue, save”; the underlying root REK is defined as “recover, get out/away, save from ruin/peril/loss”) (PE17:38)
#rem- vb. "snare"; cited in the form "remi-", apparently including the connecting vowel of the aorist tense (as in *remin "I snare"). (VT42:12)
remba- vb. "net, entrap" (VT42:12)
	rembë noun "mesh" (Appendix E, in a footnote), "hunter's or fisher's net" (VT42:29)
rembina adj. "entangled" (VT42:12); aldarembina pl. aldarembinë ”tree-tangled”, Quenya equivalent of Sindarin galadhremmin (PE17:26)
remma noun "snare" (VT42:12)
	rempa adj. "crooked, hooked" (REP)
	réna noun "edge, border, margin" (REG)
	rendë pa.t. of #rer-, q.v. (RED)
	#rer- vb. "to sow" (1st pers. aorist rerin "I sow"), pa.t. rendë (RED)
	resta noun "sown field, acre" (VT46:11 cf. RED-). The word parma-restalyanna, probably meaning *”(up)on your book-fair”, seems to use #resta in the sense of “fair” (as held in a field?) Carl F. Hostetter however suggests that #resta “fair” may be related to ré “day” (VT49:39-40); if so this word is wholly distinct from resta “sown field”.
	retto *”climber” (PE17:182, language unidentified). The form is mentioned as somehow related to the Sindarin element -reth in Orodreth (*”Mountain-climber”) and could be either Old Sindarin or the Quenya cognate. *Ret- might then be the Quenya verb for “climb”, a derivative of the root RETE of similar meaning.
	ría noun "wreath" (PM:347)
	#ric- (“k”) (1) vb. “try, put forth effort, strive, endeavour” (PE17:93, 94, 167), imperative á ricë “try!”, pl. á ricir “let them try”, á rice am(a)ricië “try harder!” (or more idiomatically á carë (sí) ancarië, lit. *“do (now) with more doing!” 
#ric- (2) vb. "twist", perfect irícië "has twisted" (VT39:9)
	ríë noun "crown" (RIG; VT46:11 indicates that the vowel í should be long)
rië noun “garland”, also apparently riendë (PE17:182). 
	riel (*riell-) noun "garlanded maiden" (SA:kal-), full form riellë noun "a maiden crowned with a festival garland" (PM:347). In Altariel, Altariellë. Compare rië. 
	riendë, see rië
	rihta- vb. "jerk, give quick twist or move, twitch" (RIK(H) )
	rillë noun "brilliance" (both the word and the gloss are uncertain, VT46:11)
	rilma noun "glittering light" (RIL)
	rilya adj.? noun? "glittering" (RIL; in the printed Etymologies the word is also glossed "brilliance", but according to VT46:11 this gloss does not properly apply to this word)
	ríma noun "edge, hem, border" (RĪ)
	rimba adj. "frequent, numerous" (RIM)
	rimbë noun "crowd, host, great number" (RIM, SA:rim, Letters:282)
	rimpa adj.? noun? "rushing, flying" (RIP; the word is more likely an adjective)
	rin noun "dew" (LT1:265; rather rossë in LotR-style Quenya)
	rína adj. "crowned" (RIG), also used as a suffix “garlanded, crowned” (PE17:182)
	rinca noun "twitch, jerk, trick, sudden move" (VT46:11 cf. RIK(H) )
	rincë ("k") (stem *rinci-, given the primitive form ¤rinki) noun "flourish, quick stroke" (RIK(H); the Etymologies as printed in LR reads "quick shake", but according to VT46:11 the correct reading is "quick stroke")
	rinda adj. "circular" (RIN)
	rindë noun "circle" (RIN)
	ringa adj. "cold" (Markirya); the Etymologies gives ringë (RINGI), but it seems that ringa is to be preferred (cf. Ringarë below). Yá hrívë tenë, ringa ná “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49:23). According to VT46:11, Tolkien originally used the form ringa in Etym as well; later he would restore it. - In early "Qenya", ringa is glossed "damp, cold, chilly" (LT1:265) 
	Ringarë noun, the twelfth and last month of the year, "December" (Appendix D, SA:ring); the word seems to mean *"Cold-day".
	ringë adj. "cold", also ringa (which form is to be preferred; cf. Ringarë in LotR). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, ringë is also given as a noun "cold pool or lake (in mountains)", but according to VT46:11 this noun should read ringwë. (RINGI)
	Ringil noun, name of one of the great Lamps (pillared on ice), apparently contains ringë (RINGI). The name was later abandoned, as Tolkien decided to call the great Lamps Illuin and Ormal.
	ringwë (1) noun "cold pool or lake (in mountains)" (VT46:11). The misreading ringë appears in Etym as printed in LR, entry RINGI.
	ringwë (2) noun "rime, frost" (LT1:265)
	*risil (þ) noun "ring" (on the ground) in Rithil-Anamo, q.v.
	rissë noun? The word is not clearly glossed but apparently means “cut” or “cleft” (ravine), the cognate of the final element of Imladris, Sindarin name of Rivendell. (PE17:87)
	rista- (1) vb. "cut" (RIS), “cleave” (PE17:87)
	rista (2) noun “cut” (RIS), cf. #1 above.
	Rithil-Anamo place name "Ring of Doom", translation of the foreign word Máhanaxar that was adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:401). Compare Anamo, q.v. Presumably *Risil-Anamo in Exilic Quenya, since the digraph th of rithil must represent the spirant þ (expressed by the letter súlë, older thúlë, in Tengwar writing).
	-ro pronominal ending "he", in antaváro, q.v. In Tolkien’s later Quenya, the ending -s covers both “he”, “she” and “it”.
	roa noun "dog" (VT47:35). Also huo.
	[rocca] noun "wheel" (VT46:12)
	rocco ("k") noun "horse" (ROK, SA:roch; Letters:382; cf. 282 where the spelling really is rocco, not rokko). In Letters:382 the word is defined as "swift horse for riding". VT46:12 refers to an alternative form of the entry ROK that was inserted into the Etymologies; here rocco, which Tolkien revised from ronco ("k"), was similarly glossed "swift horse". Nésë nórima rocco (“k”) “he was a horse strong/swift at running” (VT49:29)
	#rocindi noun "debtors" (attested in the pl. in the allative case and with a pronominal ending attached: rocindillomman "from our debtors") (VT43:20-21). Variant #rucindi (similarly isolated from rucindillomman). These forms seem to have been ephemeral; Tolkien came up with them while attempting to translate the Lord's Prayer into Quenya, but the final version uses another construction.
	#rohta noun "debt, trespass" (attested in the pl.: rohtar, and with a pronominal suffix: rohtammar "our trespasses") (VT43:19) Variant #ruhta. #Rohtalië, #ruhtalië *"trespass-people" = those who trespass (attested in the ablative: rohtaliello, ruhtaliello "from [our] debtors" (VT43:21)
	roimë noun "hunt, hunting" (the spelling "raime" in the entry ROY1  in the Etymologies as printed in LR is a misreading, VT46:12)
	roina adj. "ruddy" (ROY2)
	roita- vb. "pursue" (ROY1)
	róma (1) noun "horn" (WJ:368 - this refers to a "horn" as an instrument rather than as part of an animal; see rassë, tarca).Loose compound Oromë róma “an Oromë horn”, sc. “one of Orome's horns (if he had more than one)” (WJ:368).
	róma (2) noun "loud sound, trumpet-sound" (ROM). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, róma was also the name of tengwa #30, which letter Tolkien would later call silmë nuquerna instead.
	róma (3) noun "shoulder" (LT2:335; evidently obsoleted by # 1 and # 2 above.)
	romba noun "horn, trumpet" (ROM)
	Rómë noun ”east”, variant of Rómen (PE17:59). Possessive romeva (read rómeva?), genitive rómeö (Ibid.)
	rómen, Rómen noun "east" (RŌ, MEN, SA:men), "uprising, sunrise, east" (SA:rómen); also name of tengwa #25 (Appendix E). Possessive form rómenwa (PE17:59). Variant hrómen, PE17:18. Rómenna, a place in the eastern part of Númenor, is simply the allative "eastward" (SA:rómen), cf. also rómenna in LR:47, 56. Ablative Rómello "from the East" or "[to one] from the East", hence Tolkien's translation "to those from the East" in his rendering of Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67, PE17:59; Romello with a short o in VT49:32). Masc. name Rómendacil "East-victor" (Appendix A; cf. Letters:425). Masc. name Rómestámo, Róme(n)star "East-helper" (PM:384, 391; probably ?Rómenstar must always become Rómestar, but Tolkien cited the form as Róme(n)star to indicate the connection with rómen "east")
	rómenya adj. "eastern" (RŌ)
	róna adj.? "east" (RŌ). Compare hróna. 
[ronco], see rocco
ronda adj. “solid, firm” (PE17:183)
	rondo noun "a vaulted or arched roof, as seen from below" (and usually not visible from outside); "a (large) hall or chamber so roofed", "vaulted hall" (WJ:414; VT39:9; in the Etymologies, stem ROD, the gloss is simply "cave" or "roof"; see VT46:12 for the latter gloss). Cf. *Elerondo.
	ronta adj.? noun? "hollow" (also rotwa) (LT2:347. In Tolkien's later Quenya, the preferred words for "hollow" are unqua adj. and unquë noun.)
	ronya noun " 'chaser', hound of chase" (ROY1)
	roquen noun "horseman [but the Quenya word does not show gender], rider, knight" (WJ:372, UT:282)
	rossë noun "fine rain, dew" (ROS1, PM:371)
	rosta noun "ascent" (LT1:267)
	róta noun "tube" (LT2:347)
	rotelë noun "cave" (LT2:347)
	rotsë noun "pipe" (LT2:347); pl. rotser (?) in Narqelion? (Cf. QL:xiv)
	rotto noun "cave, tunnel" (VT46:12), "a small grot or tunnel" (PM:365)
	rotwa adj.? noun? "hollow" (also ronta) (LT2:347. In Tolkien's later Quenya, the preferred words for "hollow" are unqua adj. and unquë noun.)
	Rú noun "Drûg", Rúatan pl. Rúatani "Drúedain" (UT:385)
	#ruc- (1) ("k") vb. "feel fear or horror" (1st pers. aorist rucin "I feel fear or horror"); the verb is said to be constructed with "from" (sc. the ablative case, or prepositions like ho or va?) of the object feared. (WJ:415) Hence e.g. *rucin i ulundollo (or, *rucin ho/va i ulundo) for "I fear the monster"?
	#ruc- (2) vb. "fly (to)", in the phrase ortírielyanna rucimmë, "to thy patronage we fly" (VT44:7). If this is really the same verb as ruc- #1 above, it would indicate that ruc- combined with the allative case implies flying in horror to some refuge (denoted by the allative noun).
	rúcarë noun “evil-doing”. Variant of hrúcarë. (PE17:170)
	rúcima ("k") adj. "terrible" (WJ:415)
	rúcina ("k") adj. (or passive participle?) "confused, shattered, disordered, ruined" in Markirya (the first version of this poem had "red skies", MC:215, changed to "ruined skies" in the final version; see MC:220, note 8)
	#rucindi, see rocindi
	ruhta- (1) vb. "terrify" (WJ:415)
	ruhta (2), see rohta
	ruimen noun “fireplace, hearth” (PE17:183)
	ruina adj. “blazing, fiery” (PE17:183). Cf. ruinë.
	ruinë noun “a fire, a blaze” (PE17:183). Compare nárë.
	ruivë, also aparuivë, noun “wild fire”, fire as conflagration (PE17:183)
	rúma- vb. "shift, move, heave (of large and heavy things)"; participle rúmala in Markirya; this was changed to rúma, evidently the naked verbal stem used as participle
	Rúmil masc. name, genitive Rúmilo (WJ:398)
	rúna- vb. "[to] free" (VT43:23). Compare eterúna-, etrúna-, q.v. It is not quite clear whether rúna by itself is an adjective or a verb; the gloss "free" makes room for both interpretations. If #runando "redeemer" (q.v.) is formed from this noun, it would cover "to redeem" as well.
	#runando noun "redeemer", isolated from Mardorunando masc. name "Redeemer of the world" (VT44:17)
	runda (1) adj. “smooth, polished” (PE17:89)
	runda (2) noun "rough piece of wood" (RUD)
	rúnya noun "red flame" (SA:ruin; PM:366 gives runya)
	runya noun "slot, footprint" (RUN; according to PM:366 runya also means "red flame", but SA:ruin has rúnya for this meaning)
	rusca (1) adj. “wroth”, also ruxa (PE17:188)
	[rusca] (2) adj. "red-brown" (VT41:10)
	rusco (stem ruscu-, pl. rusqui) noun "fox" (PM:353, VT41:10) 
	ruscuitë adj. "foxy" (VT41:10)
	rúsë (þ) noun “wrath” (PE17:188)
	rúsëa (þ) adj. “wrathful” (PE17:188)
	russa adj. "red-haired" (VT41:10)
	Russandol masc. name "Copper-top", a nickname (epessë) of Maitimo/Nelyafinwë (= Maedhros) (PM:354)
	russë (1) noun "(a head or pelt of) red hair" (VT41:10)
russë (2) noun "corruscation, †sword-blade" (RUS)
	rusta adj.? "broken" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	ruste adj.? or participle? "crumbling" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	rúvina adj. (or passive particle) “burst”. A verb #ruv- “to burst” may be extrapolated; the root is given as RUVU “burst asunder” (QL:81)
	ruxa (1) adj. “wroth” (PE17:188). Also rusca.
	#ruxa- (2) vb. "crumble"; verbal stem only attested as a participle ruxal' "crumbling" in the Markirya poem, elided from *ruxala (since the next word begins in an a).
	-rya 3rd person sg. pronominal ending "his, her" and probably “its” (VT49:16, 38, 48, Nam, RGEO:67), attested in coivierya *”his/her life”, máryat "her hands", ómaryo "of her voice" (genitive of *ómarya "her voice"), súmaryassë "in her bosom" (locative of súmarya "her bosom"); for the meaning "his" cf. coarya "his house" (WJ:369). The ending is descended from primitive ¤-sjā via -zya (VT49:17) and therefore connects with the 3rd person ending -s “he, she, it”. – In colloquial Quenya the ending -rya could be used for “their” rather than “his/her”, because it was felt to be related to the plural ending -r, e.g. símaryassen “in their [not his/her] imaginations” (VT49:16, 17). See -ya #4.

<S>
	-s (1) 3rd person sg. pronominal ending "he/him, she/her, it" (VT49:48, 51), occurring in caris *“he/she/it does” (VT49:16, PE17:129), caitas *“it lies” (PE17:65), tentanes “it pointed” (VT49:26), tulis *”(s)he comes” (VT49:19), eques (q.v.), anes (see ná #1), also (in object position) in camnelyes, caritas, caritalya(s), melinyes, tiruvantes, and utúvienyes, q.v. (Tolkien mentions -s as an “objective” ending for the 3rd person sg. in PE17:110.) The longer form -së (perhaps with personal meaning “he, she” only) is said to be “rare” (VT49:51); cf. násë “he is”, nésë “he was” (see ná #1). In nésë the ending is suggested to be shortened from -sse (VT49:28), an ending that may also be attested in the untranslated verbal form tankassen (PE17:76), where it is perhaps followed by a second pronominal ending -n *”me”. According to PE17:129, the 3rd person sg. ending at one stage appeared as -ze “when pronominal affixes followed” (Tolkien citing the form carize-, e.g. apparently *carizet for “he makes them”); normally z would later become r, but it actually became (historically: reverted to) s by analogy with the short form caris as well as the independent pronoun se. Exilic Quenya would then evidently have (e.g.) *cariset for “he makes them”, with a rare example of intervocalic s that is not derived from older þ.
	-s (2) ending for the mysterious case sometimes called "respective", actually probably a shorter variant of the locative in -ssë. Pl. -is, dual -tes, partitive pl. -lis.
	sa pron. "it", 3rd person sg, corresponding to the ending -s (VT49:30). Used of inanimate things or abstracts (VT49:37; plants are considered animate; see se). For sa as object, cf. the sentence ecë nin carë sa “I can do it” (VT49:34). Stressed sá (VT49:51). Ósa *"with it" (VT43:36). Also compare the reflexive pronoun insa *"itself", q.v. – In one text, sa is also defined as “that” (VT49:18); apparently Tolkien also at one point considered giving sa a plural significance, so that it meant *“they, them” of inanimate things, the counterpart of “personal” té (VT49:51).
	sa-rincë ("k"), apparently the name of the "hook" that may be attached to a tengwa letter to indicate a following s (VT46:11). If so, sa may be a name of S (as a sound). 
	sá noun "fire" (LT1:265; "Qenya" spelling sâ. Rather nárë in LotR-style Quenya.)
	saca- ("k") (1) vb. "pursue, look for, search" (QL:81; pa.t. sácë.)
	saca- (þ) ("k") (2) vb. "draw, pull" (VT43:23; this word must come from older *þaca- because it is said to be related to sahta-, older þahta-, "induce", q.v.)
	saccantë ("k") vb. "rent" (past tense of an otherwise unattested verb #saccata- "rend"?) (SD:246)
	Sahóra "the South" (LT1:248, 255; rather Hyarmen in LotR-style Quenya)
	#sahta- (þ) vb. "induce", apparently primarily in negative sense: *"tempt, seduce”. Compare the gerund or abstract noun sahtië (þ) "pressure or force (to do something against one's will or conscience)" (VT43:22-23; also compare úsahtië.)
	saicelë noun “famine” (QL:82)
	#saila adj. "wise" (isolated from alasaila [q.v.] "unwise" in a late source)
	saira adj. "wise" (SAY, VT46:12; a later source has the alternative formation #saila as above)
sairina adj.? "magic" (evidently adj. rather than noun) (GL:72)
sairon noun "wizard" (SAY); according to LT2:337 and GL:29, Sairon is also the Quenya (or Qenya) name of Dairon (Daeron).
	saiwa adj. "hot" (LT1:248, 255, 265); rather lauca in Tolkien's later Quenya
	salma noun "lyre" (LT1:265)
	Salmar masc. name; etymology unclear - cf. salma? (Silm)
	salmë noun "harp-playing" (LT1:265; rather nandelë in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	salpa- (1) vb. "lick up, sup, sip" (SÁLAP), "take a sup of" (LT1:266) 
	salpa (2) noun "bowl" (LT1:266), also #salpë isolated from tanyasalpë "Bowl of Fire") –LT1:292
	salquë ("q") noun "grass" (SALÁK-(WĒ) )
	#sam- vb. “have” (cited as samin, 1st person sg. aorist), pa.t. sámë (PE17:173)
sáma noun "mind" (pl. sámar and dual samat [sic, read *sámat?] are given) (VT39:23, VT41:5, VT49:33, PE17:183)
	sambë (þ) noun "room, chamber" (STAB)
	samin (samind-) noun “silk” (QL:81)
	saminda, saminwa adj. “silken” (QL:81)
	samna (þ) noun "wooden post" (STAB)
	samnar noun "diphthongs" (sg. #samna "diphthong"?) (SAM; in one text probably dating to late 1930s, Tolkien rejects "osamnar" as the word for "diphthong", introducing the form ocamna to replace it. See VT44:13-14.)
	samno (þ) noun "carpenter, wright, builder" (STAB)
	#sámo (þ) noun “helper”, tentatively isolated from Rómestámo “East-helper”, q.v. When initial, st- would normally simplify as s-, for archaic þ-.
	sampa noun “spade” (QL:82, PE16:145); cf. the verb sapa- “dig”
	san (1) adv. "then" (MC:216; also twice in Narqelion), a “Qenya” term apparently replaced by tá in Tolkien’s later conception. In his later Quenya, san would be the dative form of sa “it”, hence “for it; to it”.
	san (2) adv. ephemeral word for "so" (ya(n)...san "as...so"; san na "thus be" = let it be so, "amen"); this form was apparently quickly abandoned by Tolkien (VT43:16, 24, VT49.18)
	sana (1) demonstrative “that very thing (already referred to)” (PE16:97). Sana wendë “that maiden” (PE16:96 cf. 90)
	sana (2) noun "day (24 hours)" (LT1:250; the later word ré is to be preferred to this early "Qenya" form)
	sanar noun "mind" (literally "thinker" or "reflector", suggesting an underlying verb #sana- "to think, to reflect") (VT41:13)
	Sanavaldo noun "the Almighty" (SD:401). The word is difficult to fully explain, since sana- is not elsewhere associated with the meaning “al(l)”. Compare iluvala.
	sanca (þ) ("k") noun? (or adj, or both?) "cleft, split" (STAK)
	sancë ("k") adj. "hateful" (LT2:341)
	Sancossi ("k") pl. noun "the Goblins" (LT2:341)
	sanda (þ) (1) adj. "firm, true, abiding" (STAN)
	[sanda, sandë] (þ) (2) noun "name" (VT46:16)
	sandastan noun "shield-barrier", a battle-formation (UT:282; probably with stem sandastam- since the final element is derived from a stem stama- "bar, exclude". Compare talan with stem talam- from the root TALAM.)
	sánë (þ) noun “pine” (PE17:81), stem sáni- (? – the primitive form is given as ¤thānĭ, which would normally give Quenya sánë/sáni-, but the Quenya noun is also cited as sáne- as if e persists before an ending).
	sanga (þ) noun "crowd, press, throng" (STAG, SA:thang, LT2:342; pl. sangar (?) twice in Narqelion). In Sangahyando (þ) masc. name "Throng-cleaver", name of a man in Gondor (SA:thang; a footnote in Letters:425 explains that "throng" here means a closely formed body of enemy soldiers. In the Etymologies, stems STAG, SYAD, sangahyando is said to be a swordname, and LT2:342 likewise defines the word as a name of Turambar's sword: "cleaver of throngs, Throng-cleaver".)
	#sangië (evidently þ, cf. sanga above) noun "necessity" (evidently in the sense of *"tribulation, pressure"; compare sanga, of which #sangië is an abstract formation). Isolated from sangiessemman "in our necessities" (VT44:8)
	sanganë vb.? "gather" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	sangwa noun "poison" (SAG)
	sanomë adv. “there” (PE17:71). Cf. sinomë, tanomë. 
sanwë noun "thought, an act of thinking" (VT39:23, 30; VT41:5, 13, PE17:183)
sanwecenda ("k") noun "thought-inspection, thought-reading" (VT41:5, PE17:183)
sanwë-latya noun "thought-opening", direct, telepathic thought-transfer (VT39:23)
sanwë-menta noun "thought-sending, mental message" ((VT41:5, PE17:183)
	sanya (þ) (1) adj. "regular, law-abiding, normal" (STAN); variant vorosanya with a prefixed element meaning "ever" (VT46:16)
	[sanya] (þ) (2) noun ?"name" (reading of gloss uncertain, VT46:16)
	[sanya] (þ) (3) noun "truth, fact" (VT46:16)
	sanyë (þ) noun "rule, law" (STAN)
	sap- or sapa- vb. “dig”, pa.t. sampë (PE16:145, QL:82); cf. sampa, and sapsanta below.
	sapsanta noun in allative: "grave-into" (MC:221; this is "Qenya"; notice old allative in -nta, later dual allative only)
	sar (sard-, as in pl. sardi) noun "(small) stone" (SAR). In Elessar, q.v. Since Tolkien let this name have a stem in -sarn- (genitive Ele[s]sarno, VT49:28), he may seem to have changed the stem-form of sar from sard- to sarn-. 
	sára (1) adj. "bitter" (SAG)
	sára (2) adj. "fiery" (LT1:248; this "Qenya" word may have been obsoleted by # 1 above)
	sara (3) (þ) noun "stiff dry grass, bent" (STAR). The word “bent” would here mean “open place covered with grass” (cf. LT1:274).
	sarat (pl. sarati given) noun "letter", any individual significant mark, used of the letters of Rúmil after the invention of Fëanor's tengwar (WJ:396). Cf. sarmë.
	sarco ("k") noun "flesh" (LT2:347; Tolkien's later Quenya has hrávë)
	sarcuva ("k") adj. "corporeal, bodily" (LT2:347; hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya, since it connects with sarco above)
sarda adj. "hard" (VT39:17); pl. sardë "hards" may be used in the same sense as sarda tengwi, q.v. (As an independent form we would rather expect a nominal pl. sardar.) 
#sarda tengwë noun "hard sound", a term for "consonant", but not used of semi-vowels (y, w)  and continuants (l, r, m, noun). (Only pl. sarda tengwi [ñ] is attested; we would rather expect #sardë tengwi with the pl. form of the adjective.) Sarda tengwi are also simply called sardë "hards", see sarda. (VT39:17)
sarmë noun "writing" (VT39:8). Cf. sarat.
	sarna adj. "of stone" (SAR)
	sarnë noun "stony place" (SAR; in the Etymologies as printed in LR, the gloss reads "strong place", but according to VT46:12 the proper reading is "stony place")
sarnië (sarniyë) noun "shingle, pebble-bank" (UT:463, VT42:11)
  	sarno noun “table” (QL:82)
	sarqua ("q") adj. "fleshy" (LT2:347) Compare sarco, sarcuva.
	Sarquindi ("q") pl. noun "Cannibal-ogres" (LT2:347)
	sarta adj. “steadfast, trusty, loyal” (PE17:183)
	sarto noun “trusty follower, loyal companion (member of ‘comitatus’ of a lord, or prince)”, also satar (PE17:183)
#sat- vb. "set aside, appropriate to a special purpose or owner" (VT42:20). Cited in the form "sati-"; the final -i may be simply the connecting vowel of the aorist (as in *satin "I set aside"). This verb "was in Quenya applied to time as well as space" (VT42:20)
satar noun “trusty follower, loyal companion (member of ‘comitatus’ of a lord, or prince)”, often in form sarto (PE17:183)
satto, “Qenya” numeral “two” (in Tolkien’s later Quenya atta) (VT49:54)
satya adj. "private, separate, not common, excluded" (VT42:20)
sau- prefix denoting doing something very badly, as in saucarë, q.v. (PE17:183)
saucarë noun “doing or making a thing very badly” (PE17:183)
saucarya adj. “evil-doing” (PE17:68). Cf. saucarë. 
[sauna] (þ) noun "wooden post", changed by Tolkien to samna (VT46:15)
	saura (þ) adj. "foul, evil-smelling, putrid" (THUS), “foul, vile” (PE17:183). This adjective underlies the name Sauro, Sauron (q.v.) Alternatively explained to mean “cruel” (PE17:184); a deleted gloss defined the word as “bad, unhealthy, ill, wretched” (PE17:172). Tolkien did not consistently hold that the initial s represents older þ; sometimes he derived saura (and so implicitly Sauron) from stems with original s-.
	Sauro (þ) (1), usually in longer form Sauron (þ), masc. name "the Abhorred", name of a Maia, the second Dark Lord (said to be the name by which he was "afterwards called", MR:147; according to PE17:183, his original name was Mairon, q.v.). Earlier Thauron (SA:thaur, THUS), archaic *Θaurond- (Letters:380, where the initial Greek letter represents th). The stem of Sauron would then be *Saurond-. – Another form of the name is Súro.
	[sauro] (2) (þ) noun "carpenter, wright, builder", changed by Tolkien to samno (VT46:15)
	sav- vb. “believe (that statements, reports, traditions, etc. are) true, accept as fact” (VT49:27; the fist person aorist savin is given). Not used with a person as object (in the sense of believing that this person tells the truth); with a noun, name or corresponding pronoun as object, sav- implies “I believe that he/she/it really exists/existed”: Savin Elessar “I believe that Elessar really existed” (VT49:27). To “believe in” someone meaning “believe that (s)he tells the truth” can be paraphrased as (for instance) savin Elesarno quetië “I believe in Elessar’s words” (lit. speaking). (VT49:28)
	sáva noun "juice" (SAB)
Sáya, name of the fire-fay (GL:66)
se (1) pron. "he, she, it" also object "him, her, it", 3rd person sg. Used “of living things including plants” (VT49:37; the corresponding inaimate pronoun is sa). The pronoun comes directly from se as the original stem-form (VT49:50). Stressed form sé, VT49:51, attested in object position in melin sé “I love him” (VT49:21). Ósë *"with him/her", VT43:29; see ó-. Long dative/allative sena “[to/for] him” or  “at him”, VT49:14, allative senna *“to him/her” (VT49:45, 46). Compare the reflexive pronoun insë *"himself, herself".
se (2), also long sé, preposition "at, in" (VT43:30; compare the "locative prefix" se- possibly occurring in an early "Qenya" text, VT27:25)
	selda adj.? noun? (meaning not clear, related to seldë "child" (meaning changed by Tolkien from "daughter") and seldo *"boy". Thus selda may be an adjective *"childlike", since -a is a frequent adjectival ending. Alternatively, as suggested in VT46:13, selda may be a neuter noun "child", corresponding to masc. seldo *"boy" and fem. seldë *"girl" (before Tolkien changed the meaning of the latter to "child").  (SEL-D, cf. VT46:22-23)
	seldë noun "child" (meaning changed by Tolkien from "daughter"; in his later texts the Quenya word for "child" is rather hína, and the final status of seldë is uncertain. See also tindómerel.) (SEL-D, VT46:13, 22-23) In one late source, Tolkien reverts to the meaning “daughter”, but this may have been replaced by anel, q.v.
	seldo noun (meaning not quite clear, likely the masculine form of seldë "child", hence *"boy") (SEL-D, VT46:13, 22-23)
	seler (þ) (sell-, as in pl. selli) noun "sister" (THEL/THELES). In a later source, the word nésa (q.v.) appears instead, leaving the conceptual status of seler uncertain.
	selli (þ) pl. of seler (THEL/THELES)
	*selma (þ) noun "a fixed idea, will" (WJ:319; only the archaic/Vanyarin form þelma [thelma] is given)
	[selyë noun "daughter", used in children's play for "fourth finger" or "fourth toe" (VT47:10, 15, VT48:4) It is unclear whether it was the word selyë "daughter" itself that was rejected, or just its use as a play-name of a digit. Compare yeldë, yendë.]
	sen- vb. "let loose, free, let go" (VT43:18)
	#sén collective (?) noun “children”, isolated from Erusén "the children of God" (RGEO:74, VT49:35). The word would seem to be a collective, since it has no plural ending.
	sena dative/allative pronoun “to him [/her/it]”, “at him [/her/it]”; see se. (VT49:14)
	senda adj. "resting, at peace" (SED)
	*sendë, see ser-
	senna (1), see se #1
senna (þ, cf. older form thenna) adj. “short” (PE17:185). This is a later (TLT) variant of sinta. 
	senwa, also senya, adj. “usual” (VT49:22,  35). Notice that *senya may conceivably also function as a genitive pronoun “his, her”, derived from *sen as the dative form of se #1 (compare ninya, menya).
	-ser noun "friend" (SER)
	ser- vb. "rest" (1st pers. aorist serin "I rest"); pa.t. probably *sendë since the R of ser- was originally D (cf. stem SED; compare rer- pa.t. rendë from RED concerning the past tense)
	sercë ("k") noun "blood" (SA:sereg, PE17:184; the Etymologies gives yár as the Quenya word for "blood")
	sérë noun "rest, repose, peace" (SED, VT44:35); see under úyë concerning the sentence úyë sérë indo-ninya símen in Fíriel's Song
	Serindë (þ) fem. name; "Broideress" (Silm) or "Needlewoman" (PM:333). Original form Therindë, q.v.
	sermë noun "friend" (fem.) (SER)
	sermo noun "friend" (evidently masc., since sermë is stated to be fem.) (SER)
	seron noun "friend" (SER)
	sesta- vb. “to liken, compare” (QL:82) 
	[setta, setya adj. "first" (possibly also "primary", but Tolkien's gloss was not certainly legible) (VT46:13)]
	si adv. “here” (VT49:33; this may be a root or “element” rather than a Quenya word; see sissë, sinomë) 
	sí adv. "now" (Nam, RGEO:67, LR:47, SD:310, VT43:34, VT49:18, PE17:94), sin (SI, LR:47) or sín (SD:247, 310) before vowels. Compare the distribution of a/an in English, though in his Quenya version of Hail Mary, Tolkien used sí also before a vowel (sí ar "now and", VT43:28). Si, a short (or incompletely annotated) form of sí (VT43:26, 34). – In Fíriel's Song, sí is translated "here".
	siar, siarë adv. "this day", a form Tolkien apparently abandoned in favour of síra, q.v. (VT43:18)
	sicil ("k") noun "dagger, knife" (SIK)
	sië adv. "thus" (VT43:24, VT49:18)
	sil- vb. "shine" (white), present tense síla "shines, is shining" (FG); aorist silë, pl. silir (RS:324), frequentative sisíla- (Markirya comments), future tense siluva (VT49:38), dual future siluvat (VT49:44, 45)
	#sil-cal- ("k") vb. "to shine" (silver and gold) < "Qenya" sílankálan *"they shine (silver and gold)" (VT27:20, 27); cf. sil-, cal-, q.v. 
sisilcala- ("k") vb. "to shine continuously (silver and gold)" ("Qenya" inflected form sisilkalan) (VT27:20, 26, 27)
	silda-ránar noun in locative "in gleaming-moon" (locative -r) (MC:213; this is "Qenya"; cf. sildë)
	sildai ??? (Narqelion)
	sildë adj.? "gleaming" (?) (MC:214; this is "Qenya"; cf. silda-ránar)
	silima noun the substance the Silmarils were made of, invented by Fëanor (SA:sil)
Silindo "Jupiter" (LT1:265; this planet is called Alcarinquë in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	#sillumë noun "this hour", ablative sillumello "from this hour" (VT44:35). Compare silumë.
	silma adj. "silver, shining white" (SIL), “crystal (white)” (PE17:23)
	Silmarien (sometimes "-riën") fem. name, apparently incorporates sil(i)ma (Appendix A) and the feminine ending -ien, or -rien as a variant of -riel (garlanded maiden) as in Altariel (Galadriel).
	Silmaril (Silmarill-, as in pl. Silmarilli), noun, name of the shining jewels made by Fëanor; full sg. form Silmarillë (SA:sil, SIL, RIL, MIR). Translated "radiance of pure light" in Letters:148. Gen. pl. Silmarillion, as in (Quenta) Silmarillion "(the Story) of the Silmarils".
	silmë noun "starlight", also name of tengwa #29 (Appendix E), though in the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, the name silmë instead applied to tengwa #3 (VT46:13). Silmë nuquerna "s reversed", name of tengwa #30, similar to normal silmë but turned upside down (Appendix E). In the Etymologies, stem SIL, silmë is defined as the "light of Silpion" (Telperion), and also a poetic word for "silver".
	Silmeráno noun in genitive, "of silver moon" (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
	Silmerossë, a name of Silpion (Telperion) (ROS1, SIL)
	silo adv. “hence” (from here), also sio (VT49:18). The words seem to incorporate -lo, a shorter version of the ablative ending -llo, and -o, the genitive ending that may also be used in an ablativic sense. Compare talo, tó “thence”.
	Silpion, a name of the Elder of the Two Trees of Valinor (Telperion, the White Tree). (Silm, SIL, SÍLIP, BAL, ROS1, LR:385) In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, the name Silpion is also applied to tengwa #29, which letter Tolkien would later call silmë instead.
	silquelosseën ("q") noun "blossom-white hair" (MC:216; this is "Qenya", but compare lossë)
	silumë adv. “at this time” (VT49:11, 18). Compare talumë, #sillumë.
	síma noun “mind, imagination” (VT49:16); variant isima. Also attested with endings: símaryassen “in their imaginations” (with the ending -rya used = “their” rather than “his/her”, according to colloquial useage) (VT49:16)
	simen adv. “hither” (VT49:33), símen "here" (FS; cf. sinomë in EO). Compare tamen.
	simpa noun "pipe, flute" (LT1:266) 
	simpetalla ??? (Narqelion)
	simpetar noun "piper" (LT1:266)
	simpina noun "pipe, flute" (LT1:266)
	simpisë noun? "piping" (LT1:266)
	sin (1) a word either meaning "thus" (adverb) or "this" (as an independent word in the sentence, not modifying another word like sina does). Attested in the sentence sin quentë Quendingoldo Elendilenna, either *"this Pengolodh said to Elendil" or "thus spoke Pengolodh to Elendil" (PM:401). Patrick Wynne argues that sin is an adverb “thus” derived from the stem si- “this (by me)” (VT49:18)
	sin (2) adv., a form of sí "now" (q.v.) often occurring before vowels; also sín (SI). However, sí itself (q.v.) may also appear before a vowel.
	sina demonstrative "this" (following its noun in our sole example: vanda sina "this oath"). (CO, VT49:18; in the latter source, sina is called an adjective). This word would, like Sindarin hen, be derived from primitive ¤sĭnā (VT49:34). Cf. sin #1.
sína passive participle “known, certain, ascertained” (PE17:68), connecting with ista- and sintë. Also sinwa.
	sincahonda adj. "flint-hearted" (LotR3:VI ch. 6). Hence noun #sinca "flint-[stone]"?
	sinda (þ) adj. "grey" (PE17:72); nominal pl. Sindar used = "Grey-elves", lit. *"Grey ones"; see WJ:375. Gen. pl. Sindaron in WJ:369. With general meaning "grey" also in Sindacollo > Singollo "Grey-cloak, Thingol" (SA:thin(d), PE17:72; see also sindë, Sindicollo); †sindanórië "grey land", ablative sindanóriello "from/out of a grey country" (Nam); the reference is to a “mythical region of shadows lying at outer feet of the Mountains of Valinor” (PE17:72). However, other sources give sindë (q.v.) as the Quenya word for "grey"; perhaps sinda came to mean primarily "Grey-elf" as a noun. Derived adjective Sindarin "Grey-elven", normally used as a noun to refer to the Grey-elven language. (Appendix F)
	sindarinwa (þ) adj. "Grey-elven" in the phrase hwesta sindarinwa "Grey-elven hw" (Appendix E); it may really be "Sindarin" (as a noun) with the possessive ending -va, -wa appended, hence literally "hw of [the] Sindarin [language]"
	sindë (þ) adj. "grey, pale or silvery grey" (the Vanyarin dialect preserves the older form þindë) (WJ:384, THIN; in SA:thin(d) the form given is sinda, cf. also sindanóriello "from a grey country" in Namárië. Sindë and sinda are apparently variants of the same word.) Stem sindi-, given the primitive form ¤thindi; cf. Sindicollo (q.v.)
	sindië (þ) noun "greyness", sindië-nórë *”land of greyness”, also (more literally corresponding to the English translation) nórë sindiëo (PE17:72), other names of sindanórië, see sinda. 
	sinen adv. “in this way; so” (VT49:18)
	Sindel (þ) (Sindeld-, as in pl. Sindeldi) noun "Grey-elf" = Sinda pl. Sindar, but less common (WJ:384)
	sindi noun "river" (LT1:265; rather sírë in LotR-style Quenya)
	Sindicollo (þ) noun "Grey-cloak", title of Elwë (Elu). Sindarin Thingol. (WJ:410, MR:217). (Sindi- in this name is a compound form of sindë, q.v.) Original form Thindicollo (WJ:333). The Silmarillion appendix (SA:thin(d) ) gives Sindacollo.

	singwa adj. "salt" (salty) (QL:83)
	Singollo (þ) contraction of Sindicollo, q.v. (Silm)
	sinomë compound noun "this place" (EO), used as adverb (or uninflected locative) = "in this place" = "here" (VT49:18). Variant sínomë (VT44:36). Cf. sanomë, tanomë. 
	sinqui ("q") ??? (Narqelion)

	sissë adv. “here” (VT49:18), also sís
	Sistar ??? (VT45:12; the word is not clearly defined)
*sistë (*sisti-) may be a possible phonological updating of the "Qenya" noun sist (sisty-) "ulcer". Adj. sistina "ulcerated" (QL:86)
	sitë adj. “of this sort” (VT49:18)  
	siulë noun "incitement" (SIW)
	sívë (1) prep. "as", apparently ve of similar meaning with the prefix sí- "this, here, now"; sívë therefore makes a comparison with something close, whereas tambë (q.v.) refers to something remote. Sívë...tambë "as...so" (VT43:17). Elided sív' in VT43:12, since the next word begins in the vowel e-.
	sívë (2) noun "peace" (VT44:35)
	sívë (3) noun “knowing, knowledge” (PE17:68; probably never meant to coexist with #1 and #2 above, so istya may be preferred)

soica ("k") adj. "thirsty" (VT39:11)
	solmë noun "wave" (LT1:266)
	Solonel (Soloneld-) noun, a name of the Teleri (here in the sg, pl. Soloneldi). Note that this form is influenced by Telerin; pure Quenya has Solonyeldi, sg. #Solonyel. (PHAL/PHÁLAS, NYEL, SOL)

	sóra adj. "long, trailing" (LT2:344)
	sorna (þ) adj. "steadfast” (PE17:113)
	sornion noun "eyrie" (LT1:266)
	sorno (þ) noun "eagle" (archaic thorno) (Letters:427). Also soron. Early "Qenya" has sor, sornë (LT1:266)
	soron (or sornë) (þ) noun "eagle", before an ending sorn- as in pl. sorni, "gen.sg....sornen"; in LotR-style Quenya this would be the dative singular instead (THOR/THORON). SD:290 has the pl. soroni "eagles", changed to sorni as in the Etymologies. Early "Qenya" has the forms sor, sornë (LT1:266)
	Sorontar (þ) masc. name "King of Eagles", Sindarin Thorondor, name of a great Eagle (SA:thoron, THOR/THORON, TĀ/TA3)
	Soronto (þ?), masc. name, seems to incorporate soron "eagle"; the ending -to is rare (occurs in suhto, q.v.), here apparently used to derive a masculine name.
	Soronúmë (prob. þ) (name of a constellation, apparently incorporating soron "eagle") (SA:thoron)
	sovallë noun “washing, bathing; purification” (QL:86)
	sovo- vb. “wash” (read perhaps #sov- if the verb is to be adapted to LotR-style Quenya, since Tolkien’s later versions of the language do not seem to have o-stem verbs), pa.t. sóvë (QL:86)
	-ssë (1) locative ending (compare the preposition se, sé "at", q.v.); in Lóriendessë, lúmessë, máriessë, yalúmessë (q.v. for reference); pl. -ssen in yassen, lúmissen, mahalmassen, símaryassen, tarmenissen, q.v. Pronouns take the simple ending -ssë, even if the pronoun is plural by its meaning (messë “on us”, VT44:12). The part. pl. (-lissë or -lissen) and dual (-tsë) locative endings are known from the Plotz letter only.
	-ssë (2), 3rd person sg. reflexive ending, melissë “he loves himself”, possibly also quernessë *”he turned (himself)” (VT49:20-21). Compare -ttë #2. The ending -ssë seems prone to confusion with the locative ending; an alternative wording would be the analytical construction *melis immo with a separate reflexive pronoun. Tolkien himself changed quernessë to quernes immo (VT49:20-21). 
	-ssë (3) possible longer form of the 3rd person ending -s; see -s #1. Such an ending probably could not coexist with -ssë #2 above. In one source, Tolkien first queried, then deleted this ending (VT49:49).
	-sta (1) “your”, dual 2nd person possessive pronominal ending: “of you two” (VT49:45, 16), cf. -stë (q.v.) Genitive -sto in veryanwesto “of your wedding” (VT49:45) and tengwiesto “of your reading” (VT49:47), allative -stanna in parmastanna  “on your book” (VT49:47). An archaic ending of similar form could also be the third person dual *“of the two of them” (but according to VT49:51, the corresponding subject ending was changed to -ttë, and then the ending for “their” would presumably become *-tta)
	-sta (2) ending occurring in the names of certain lands (VT43:15), e.g. the Forostar or "Northlands" of Númenor (UT:165)
	-stë “you”, 2nd person dual pronominal ending (VT49:51, 53), e.g. caristë *”the two of you do” (VT49:16). Tolkien first wrote carindë, but changed the ending (VT49:33). The ending -stë is derived from earlier -dde (VT49:46, 51). An archaic ending of similar form could also be the third person dual, *“the two of them” (but see -ttë #1). 
	sú noun "sound of wind" (VT47:12), "noise of wind" (LT1:266, "Qenya" spelling sû)
	suc- ("k") vb. "to drink" (1st pers. aorist sucin "I drink") (SUK)
	suctë ("k") "resin, gum"; read *suhtë if the word is to be used in LotR-style Quenya, since Tolkien decided that ct becomes ht in Quenya. (QL:86)
	*suhtë, see suctë
	suhto noun "draught" (SUK)
	sulca ("k") noun "root" (especially as edible) (SÚLUK)
súlë (þ) noun "spirit, breath", also name of tengwa #9; originally thúlë (þúlë), before the shift th > s that occurred shortly before the rebellion of the Noldor (Appendix E, THŪ). Its gloss, “blowing forth”, was metaphorically used as “the emission of power (of will or desire) from a spirit” (PE17:124). If the element súlë appears in Súlimë and Súlimo (q.v.), the stem-form may seem to be súli-.
	súlimarya ??? (Narqelion)
	Súlimë noun, third month of the year, "March". The word apparently means *"windy one" (Appendix D; SA:sûl; not capitalized in the latter source). Early "Qenya" has súlimë "wind" (LT1:266)
	Súlimo (þ) surname of Manwë (wind-god) (THŪ, SA:sûl). Compare súlë and perhaps sú.
	súlo (stem *súlu-, given the primitive form ¤suglu; the pl. may be *súlwi) noun "goblet" (SUG; see SUK; apparently changed by Tolkien from súla, VT46:16)
	sulp- vb. "lick" (LT1:266; rather lav- in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	sulpa noun "soup" (LT1:266)
	súma noun "hollow cavity, bosom"; cf. súmaryassë "in her bosom" (súma-rya-ssë "bosom-her-in") in Markirya
	sundo (þ) noun "base, root, root-word" (SUD), sc. a Quendian consonantal "base". According to VT46:16, Tolkien changed the root to STUD, thereby implying that sundo was earlier þundo (compare Sindarin thond "root"). PE18:95 gives the pl. form as sundur, seemingly implying a stem-form sundu-. It is not, however, used in the compound sundocarmë “base-structure” (PE18:84 – not **sunducarmë), a term used in the description of the structure of the various Quendian “bases” or roots.
	sundóma (þ) noun *"base-vowel" (sundo + óma), the determinant vowel of a "base" or root  (Christopher Tolkien gives the example KAT, which stem has the sundóma A; the stem TALAT has the sundóma repeated; in derivative forms the sundóma might be placed before the first consonant; e.g. ATALAT) (WJ:319)
	sungwa noun "drinking-vessel" (SUK)
	súrë noun "wind", stem súri- because of primitive form sūrǐ- (PE17:62), hence the instrumental form súrinen "in the wind" or more literally *"by the wind" (Nam, RGEO:66, Markirya, J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator p. 197); Súrion masc.name, *"Wind-son" (Appendix A). Early "Qenya" has súru (MC:213, 216, 220). See also súriquessë.
	#surië (þ), possibly a noun *"seeking"; see minasurië.
	súriquessë noun "wind feather" (referring to a "tuft of radiating grass" in a drawing by Tolkien) (J.R.R. Tolkien: Artist & Illustrator, p. 197)
	Súro (þ) masc. name, alternative form of Sauro(n) (THUS)
	súru noun "wind" (MC:213, 216, 220; this is "Qenya"; Tolkien's later Quenya has súrë)
	surya noun "spirant consonant" (SUS)
	súya- (þ) vb. "breathe" (THŪ)
	súyer ??? (Narqelion)

<T>
	-t (1) dual ending, on nouns denoting a pair of something: attat "2 fathers or neighbours" (VT48:19; see atto), máryat "her (pair of) hands" (Nam), siryat "two rivers" (VT47:11), ciriat "2 ships" (Letters:427 – read ciryat as in the Plotz Letter?), maquat "group of ten" (from maqua, meaning among other things "group of five") (VT47:7), nápat "thumb and index as a pair" (VT48:5), also compare met "us two" as the dual form of me "us" (Nam, VT47:11). Other dual endings known from the Plotz letter: genitive -to, possessive -twa, dative -nt, locative -tsë, allative -nta, ablative -lto, instrumental -nten, plus -tes as a possible short locative. It may be that these endings only apply to nouns that would have nominative dual forms in -t, and that nouns preferring the alternative dual ending -u would simply add the otherwise "singular" case endings to this vowel, e.g. *Alduo rather than ?Alduto as the genitive form of "Two Trees" (Aldu).  – The ending -t is also used as a verbal inflection, corresponding to pl. -r (elen atta siluvat, “two stars shall shine”, VT49:45; the verb carit “do” would also be used with a dual subject, VT49:16; cf. also the endings listed in VT49:48, 50).
	-t (2) "them", pronominal ending; seen in the word laituvalmet "we shall bless them" (lait-uva-lme-t "bless-shall-we-them"). According to PE17:110, this -t covers both sg. and dual. Also independent word te pl. and tú dual (possibly *tu when unstressed).
	-t (3) reduced pronominal affix of the 2. person, "you" (sg.), the long form being -tyë (both endings are listed in VT49:48). See heca regarding the example hecat (WJ:364). However, in a later source, Tolkien denies that -tyë has any short form (VT49:51, 57). The status of the ending -t is therefore doubtful.
	ta (1) pron. "that, it" (TA); compare antaróta "he gave it" (FS); see anta-. The forms tar/tara/tanna “thither”, talo/tó “thence” and tás/tassë “there” are originally inflected forms of this pronoun: *”to that”, *”from that” and *”in that” (place), respectively. Compare “there” as one gloss of ta (see #4).
ta (2) adv. “so, like that, also”, e.g. ta mára “so good” (VT49:12)
	ta (3) pron. "they, them", an "impersonal" 3rd person pl. stem, referring "only to 'abstracts' or to things (such as inanimates) not by the Eldar regarded as persons" (VT43:20, cf. ta as an inanimate Common Eldarin plural pronoun, VT49:52). Compare te, q.v. The word ta occurring in some versions of Tolkien's Quenya Lord's Prayer may exemplify this use of ta as an "impersonal" plural pronoun: emmë avatyarir ta "we forgive them" (VT43:8, 9; this refers to trespasses, not the trespassers). However, since Tolkien also wanted ta to mean “that” (see #1 above), he may seem to be somewhat dissatisfied with ta “they, them”, introducing variant forms like tai (VT49:32) to free up ta as a sg. pronoun. In one document, tai was in turn altered to te (VT49:33), which could suggest that the distinction between animate and inanimate “they, them” was abandoned and the form te (q.v.) could be used for both. In some documents, Tolkien seems to use tar as the plural form (VT49:56 mentions this as an uncertain reading in a source where the word was struck out; compare ótar under ó-).
	ta (4) conj., said to be a reducted form of tá “then”, used “before each new item in a series or list”; “if as often in English the equivalent of and was omitted, and placed only before a final item [e.g. ‘Tom, Dick, and Harriet’], this would in Quenya represent a discontinuity, and what followed after ta would be an addition of something overlooked or less important”. (PE17:70) Hence the use of arta (ar ta, “and ta”) for “et cetera”; in older language ta ta or just ta. 
	ta (5) adv. “there” (VT49:33; this may be an Elvish root or “element” rather than a Quenya word; see tanomë; see however also tar, tara, tanna under ta #1).
	tá 1) adv. “then” (VT49:11). Cf. ta #4. 
	tá 2) adj. "high" (LT1:264; there spelt tâ. This is hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya, but cf. tára "lofty".)
	tac- ("k") vb. "fasten" (the form tacë given in the Etymologies is translated "he fastens", evidently the 3rd person sg. aorist), pa.t. tancë (TAK)
tai (1) pron. "that which, what", “which fact” (VT42:34, VT49:12, 20). The word occurs in the sentence alasaila ná lá carë tai mo navë mára, translated "it is unwise not to do what one judges good". So tai = "what", but it means more literally "that which" (VT49:12), ta + i (cf. ta #1 and the use of i as a relative pronoun). In one note, Tolkien emended tai to ita, reversing the elements (VT49:12) and also eliminating the ambiguity involving the homophone tai #2, see below.
tai (2) pron. “they, them”, 3rd person pl., used with reference to inanimates rather than persons or living things (VT49:32, see ta #3 above). Perhaps to avoid the clash with tai “that which”, the pronoun tai “they, them” was altered to te in at least one manuscript (VT49:33), so that it would merge with the pronoun used of living beings and the distinction between animate and inanimate would be abandoned (see te).
tai (3) adv. “then”, also tá (which form may be preferred because tai has other meanings as well) (VT49:33)
tailë noun "lengthening, extension" (TAY)
	#taima noun "lengthening, extension" in ómataima, q.v.
	Taimavar masc. name "Shepherd of the Sky", Orion (LT1:268; Orion is called Telumehtar or Menelmacar in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Taimë, Taimië noun "the sky" (LT1:268; rather menel in LotR-style Quenya)
	Taimondo, also Taimordo masc. name "Orion" (LT1:268; Orion is rather called Telumehtar or Menelmacar in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	taina (1) adj. "lengthened, extended" (TAY), "stretched, elongated" (VT39:7), also noun "extension" in the compound ómataina, q.v.
	#taina (2) noun “sign”, isolated from Tainacolli *”Sign-bearer” –MR:385
	taita- vb. "to prolong" (TAY)
	taitë adj. “of that sort” (VT49:11), *”such”
	tál (tal-, as in "g.sg. talen"; in LotR-style Quenya this is rather the dative singular) noun "foot" (TAL, VT49:17). Also tala (VT49:42). Pl. táli “feet” (PE16:96); here Tolkien did not use tal- with a short a as the stem-form. VT43:16 mentions "an unpublished declension" of this word dating from ca. 1967; here the locative is said to appear as talassë and talsë. Cf. also talya “his foot”; see -ya #4. Early "Qenya" forms: tala "foot" (LT2:347) and dual talwi "the feet" (LT2:347); tálin "feet" (MC:216); instrumental talainen, talalínen (MC:213, 216, 220; this is "Qenya")
	talaitë adj. “footed” (VT49:42); cf. attalaitë
	talan (talam-, e.g. pl. talami) noun "floor, base, ground" (TALAM)
	talantië vb. "he is fallen" (FS; see -ië #2 concerning the doubtful authority of this stative verb ending in LotR-style Quenya)
	talas noun "sole" (LT2:347; Tolkien's later Quenya has tallunë)
	talat- vb. a stem used for "slipping, sliding, falling down" (Letters:347), cf. atalta-, talta- and talantië 
#talca ("k") noun "post, mark" isolated from lantalca "boundary post or mark" (VT42:28)
	tallunë noun "sole of foot", stem probably talluni- given primitive form ¤talrunya (TALAM, RUN)
	talma noun "base, foundation, root" (TALAM), also translated “bottom” in the expression “top to bottom”, see below.% Talmar Ambaren (place-name, *"Foundations of the World" - this is pre-classical "Qenya" with genitive in -en instead of -o as in LotR-style Quenya) (TALAM). Allative talmanna in the phrase telmello talmanna "from hood to base, top to bottom" (VT46:18; notice misreading "telmanna" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry TEL-, TELU-)
	talo adv. “thence”. Also tó. Basically these are simple ablative/genitive forms of ta (#1) “that”; compare silo, sio. (VT49:11)
	talumë adv. “at this time” meaning “at the time we are thinking of of speaking of”, not referring to the present (which is silumë = “at this time” in the narrower sense). (VT49:11)
	talta adj. "sloping, tilted, leaning"; also "incline" as noun (TALÁT)
	talta- vb. "slip, slide down, collapse, slope" (TALÁT); reduplicated stem in the participle talta-taltala in Markirya, simply translated "falling" in MC:215. Strong intransitive conjugation: present talta, aorist talt- [derived from talati > tal’ti, hence presumably *talti- with endings and *taltë without any], past talantë, perfect ataltië. Weak transitive conjugation: present taltëa, aorist talta, past taltanë. This is said to be the conjugation type of a certain class of verbs, namely “√TALAT stems” (PE17:186).
	taltil (taltill-, pl. taltilli given) noun "toe" (VT47:10)
	taltol noun "big toe" (VT47:10); also tolbo

	taman noun “a thing made by handicraft” (PE17:107)
	tamba- vb. "to knock, keep on knocking" (TAM)
	tambaro noun "woodpecker" (TAM)
	tambë prep. (1) "so" or "as" (referring to something remote; contrast sívë). Sívë...tambë "as...so" (VT43:17).
	tambë (2) noun "copper" (LT1:250; this is "Qenya"; see urus for a later word for "copper")
	tambina adj. "of copper" (LT1:250; rather *urustina in later Quenya, see urus, urust-)

	tamma noun “tool” (PE17:108)
	tamna adj. “artificial” or noun “artifact” (PE17:108)

	tampa noun "stopper" (TAP)
	tampë noun "copper" (LT1:268; in LotR-style Quenya tampë is [also?] the past tense of tap- "stop, block")
	tampë pa.t. of tap-, q.v. (TAP)
	tampo noun “well” (QL:93)
	tana (1) demonstrative "that" (said to be "anaphoric") (TA). According to VT49:11, tana is the adjective corresponding to ta, “that” as a pronoun.
	tana- (2) vb. "to show, indicate" (MR:350, 385, 471) (cf. the demonstrative tana "that")
	tána (meaning unclear, probably adj. "high, lofty, noble") (TĀ/TA3). Compare tára.
	tanca ("k") adj. "firm, fixed, sure" (TAK)
	tancë ("k") pa.t. of tac-, q.v. (TAK)
	tancil ("k") noun "pin, brooch" (TAK)
	Tancol ("k") noun "Signifer", "the significant star" = Venus (MR:385). The literal meaning is apparently *”sign-bearer”, cf. tanna #1 and #col-.
	tande adv. "thither" (MC:215; this is "Qenya")
	tanen, tánen adv. “in that way”, “therefore” (VT49:11). Basically the instrumental form of ta (#1) “that”.
	tango noun "twang" (TING/TANG)
	tangwa noun "hasp, clasp" (TAK)
	taniquelassë noun name of tree (UT:167), perhaps Tanique(til) + lassë "leaf"
	Taniquetil (Taniquetild-), place-name: the highest of the mountains of Valinor, upon which were the mansions of Manwë and Varda. Properly, this name refers to the topmost peak only, the whole mountain being called Oiolossë (SA:til). The Etymologies has Taniquetil, Taniquetildë ("q") (Ta-niqe-til) ("g.sg." Taniquetilden, in LotR-style Quenya this is the dative singular) "High White Horn" (NIK-W, TIL, TA/TA3, OY). Variant Taníquetil with a long í, translated “high-snow-peak” (PE17:26, 168).
	tanna (1) noun "sign, token" (MR:385, PE17:186), also tanwa (PE17:186)
	tanna (2) pron. in allative "thither" (VT14:5, PE16:96; evidently to be understood as the allative of ta #2: "to that [place]"). Compare tar and locative tassë.
	tano noun "craftsman, smith" (TAN), cf. final element -tan in calmatan “lampwright” (PE17:123), Ciryatan *”ship-builder” (Appendix A).
	tanomë adv. “in the place (referred to)” (VT49:11). Cé tulis, tanomë nauvan *”if (s)he comes, I will be there” (VT49:19). Compare sanomë, sinomë.

	tanta (2) (prob. adj.) "double" (TATA)
	tantila noun "harp" (VT41:10)

	tanwë noun "craft, thing made, device, construction" (TAN)
	tanya demonstrative "that" (MC:215; this is "Qenya", perhaps corresponding to later tana)
	tap- vb. "stop, block" (the form tapë given in the Etymologies is translated "he stops, blocks", evidently the 3rd person sg. aorist. In Etym as printed in LR, a was misprinted as á, cf. VT46:17). Pa.t. tampë (TAP)
tapta adj. "impeded" (VT39:17); the nominal pl. taptar is used as a noun to express "consonants" ( = tapta tengwi, q.v.)
#tapta tengwë phrase only attested in the pl.: tapta tengwi ("ñ") "impeded elements", a term for consonants. (In the pl. we would rather expect *taptë tengwi with the pl. form of the adjective.) Also simply tapta pl. taptar (VT39:17)
	tar (1) adv. or technically pron. with old allative ending: "thither" (TA). This is ta #1 with the same allative ending -r (from primitive -da) as in mir "into". Compare tanna. According to VT49:11, tar may also appear in the logner form tara.
	tar (2) prep. "beyond" (FS)
	#tar- (3) vb. “stand”, attested in the past tense: tarnë (PE17:71)
	-tar or tar-, element meaning "king" or "queen" in compounds and names (TĀ/TA3), e.g. Valatar; compare the independent nouns tár, tári. Prefix Tar- especially in the names of the Kings and Queens of Númenor (e.g. Tar-Amandil); see their individual names (like Amandil in this case), cf. also Tar-Mairon “King Excellent”, title used by Sauron (PE17:183). Also in Tareldar "High-elves"; see also Tarmenel.
	tár noun "king" (only used of the legitimate kings of whole tribes); the pl. tári "kings" must not be confused with the sg. tári "queen" (TĀ/TA3). Prefix tar-, compare -tar above. The normal Quenya word for "king" is aran, but compare Tarumbar.
	tara adv. “thither”; see tar #1.
	tára (1) adj. "lofty". (SA:tar, LT1:264, TĀ/TA3 (AYAK, TÁWAR), VT45:6), "tall, high" (WJ:417). Compare antara. Adverb táro in an early "Qenya" text (VT27:20, 26). The adj. tára is not to be confused with the continuative form of the verb #tar- “stand”.
	tára (2) ?“wise”. (From tentative notes trying to explain Daur [unlenited *Taur] as Sindarin name of Frodo; the more normal word for “wise” seems to be saila/saira.)
taracu- ("k") noun "ox" (LT2:347, GL:69). Tolkien apparently invented the word mundo for his later form of Quenya.
taran (1) noun “king”, possibly ephemeral variant of aran, q.v. (PE17:186)
	taran (2), also tarambo, noun "buffet" (= a blow, a bang) (LT2:337, QL:89)
	Tarannon masc. name; ?"High-gift"? Or, if -annon is a Sindarin-influenced form of andon "great gate" rather than a masculinized form of anna "gift", "Lord of the Gate"??? (Appendix A)
	taras noun, Quenya equilvalent of Sindarin barad “a great towering building, (fort, city, castle) tower” (PE17:22), also tarminas. Barad-dûr (Dark Tower) = Quenya Taras Lúna (or Lúnaturco, q.v.) 
	tarassë ??? (Narqelion)
	tarca ("k") noun "horn" (TARÁK)
	tarcalion = Tar-Calion, masc. name, Quenya name of Ar-Pharazôn (LR:47, SD:246); see Calion
	Tar-culu ("k"), name listed in the Etymologies but not elsewhere attested. The second element is apparently culu "gold" (a word Tolkien seems to have abandoned); Hostetter and Wynne suggest that this may be an alternative name of Tar-Calion (= Ar-Pharazôn "the Golden"); see VT45:24.
Tarcil ("k") (#Tarcild-, as in pl. Tarcildi) masc. name, "high-Man", also used as a term for Númenórean (Appendix A, TUR, KHIL, VT46:17, PE17:101; the latter source provides the gloss "Great Man of Numenor"; tarcil(di) = "high-men = Elf-friends of Númenor"). Cf. the variant tarhildi, q.v.
	tárë adv.? "in that day", not translated in its first occurrence in Fíriel's Song
	Tareldar pl. noun "High-elves" (MR:349), sg. #Tarelda
	tarhildi, pl. noun “High-men, the Noble followers” (PE17:18), referring to the Dúnedain. Sg. perhaps #tarhil (with stem #tarhild-), cf. tarcil. 
	tári noun "queen", used especially of Varda (TĀ/TA3, LT1:264), etymologically "she that is high" (SA:tar). Dative tárin in the Elaine inscription (VT49:40), genitive tário in Namárië. Elentári "Starqueen", a title of Varda. (Nam, RGEO:67). Tarinya "my queen" (UT:179; sic, not *tárinya). Táris or tárissë “queenship” (PE17:155)
	tárië noun "height", allative tárienna "to [the] height" (LotR3:VI ch. 4, translated in Letters:308)
	Tárion noun, alternative name of Valanya, the last day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Powers (Valar) (Appendix D)
	táris (*táriss-), tarissë noun “queenship” (PE17:155)
	tarma noun "pillar" (SA:tar); Tarmasundar (þ) "the Roots of the Pillar", the slopes of Mt. Meneltarma in Númenor (UT:166)
	#tarmen noun "high place" (pl. locative tarmenissen in VT44:34)
	Tarmenel place-name "High Heaven" (LotR1:II ch. 1, VT44:34, in the latter source also locative tarmeneldë), Tar-menel "the true firmament", as opposed to Nur-menel (q.v.) (MR:388) 
	tarminas noun “tower” etc. (Sindarin barad); see taras (PE17:22)
	tarna noun "crossing, passage" (LT2:347)
	[Tarnumen] place-name *"High west" (???) (VT45:38)
	Tarondor masc. name, *"Lord of Ondor (Gondor)" (Appendix A)
	Tarostar masc. name, *"Lord of ostar [?]" (Appendix A)
	tarquendi ("q") noun "High-elves" = Lindar (= the later Vanyar; Tolkien revised the names) Sg. #tarquendë (TĀ/TA3)
	tarquesta ("q") noun "high-speech" (that is Lindarin [later Vanyarin, Tolkien revised the names], or Qenya [Quenya]) (TĀ/TA3)
taru noun "horn" (LT2:337, 347; Tolkien's later Quenya has tarca)
	tarucca ("k") adj. "horned" (LT2:347)
	tarucco ("k") noun "bull" (also tarunco) ("k") (LT2:347; Tolkien's later Quenya has mundo)
	Taructarna ("k") place-name "Oxford" (LT2:347; this "Qenya" word would have to become Taruhtarna in LotR-style Quenya)
	*Taruhtarna see Taructarna 
	Tarumbar noun; apparently "King of the World" (possibly an ephemeral form): this would be tár "king" (q.v.) + umbar as a variant of Ambar "world".
	tarunco ("k") noun "bull" (also tarucco) ("k") (LT2:347; Tolkien's later Quenya has mundo)
	tarwa noun “garden, enclosure” (QL:87)
	tarwë noun “cross, Crucifix” (QL:89)
	tarwesta- vb. “crucify” (QL:89)
	tarya adj. "tough, stiff" (TÁRAG)
	taryo, see ataryo
	tás adv. “there” (VT49:11); also tassë, q.v.
	tasar, tasarë (þ) noun "willow-tree" (TATHAR). In Tasarinan *"Willow-valley", Nan-tasarion *"Valley of willows" (SA:tathar)
	tasarin noun "willow" (LT2:346; in Tolkien's later Quenya tasar, tasarë)
	Tasarinan (þ) place-name *"Willow-vale", also Nan-Tasarion (LotR2:III ch. 4)
	tassa noun "index finger"; also lepetas (VT48:5, 14)
	tassë adv. “there” (VT49:11), short form tás. These seem to be properly locative forms of ta “that, it”, hence “in that [place]”. Compare allative tanna “thither” and ablative talo “thence”. 
	[tastil noun "index finger" (VT47:26)]
táta noun "hat" (GL:71)
tatanya *"my father" or *"my daddy" (UT:190)
tatya archaic ordinal "second". Nominal pl. Tatyar *"Seconds, Second Ones", the original name of the Noldor as the Second Clan of the Elves (or rather the direct Quenya descendant of the original name, which was probably *Tatjāi). (WJ:380) Later, tatya as an ordinal was replaced by attëa (VT42:25).
	tatya- vb. "to double" (TATA)
	tauca (“k”) “stiff, wooden” (PE17:115)
	taulë noun "great tree" (LT1:267)
	tauno noun "forest" (LT1:267; in Tolkien's later Quenya taurë)
	taura adj. "mighty, masterful" (TUR, PE17:115), "very mighty, vast, of unmeasured might or size" (VT39:10). Cf. túrëa. 
	taurë noun "(great) wood, forest" (SA:taur, Letters:308, TÁWAR. VT39:7), pl. tauri in Markirya
	Taurë Huinéva place-name "Forest of Shadow", Sindarin Taur na Fuin (PHUY, VT46:10)
	#taurëa adj. "forested" in Tumbaletaurëa, see Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna...
	taurelasselindon "like leaves of forests" (MC:213, 220; this is a "Qenya" similative form: taure-lasseli-ndon "forest-leaves-like")
	Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurëa Lómëanor "Forestmanyshadowed-deepvalleyblack Deepvalleyforested Gloomyland", Quenya elements agglutinated in Entish fashion; this supposedly means something like "there is a black shadow in the deep dales of the forest" (LotR2:III ch. 4; translated in Appendix F under "Ents"; cf. also Letters:308) Earlier (TLT) version in TI:415: Tauretavárëa Tumbalemorna Tumbaletaurëa landatavárë, perhaps *"forest-wooden deepvalleyblack deepvalleyforested wide-wood."
	Tauremorna place-name, "black forest" (LotR2:III ch. 4, translated in PE17:82). Tauremornalómë place-name, *"Forest (of) Black Night" (LotR2:III ch. 4)
	tauretavárëa, see #tavárëa
	taurina adj. "of wood" (TÁWAR)
	tautamo noun “carpenter (carver)” (PE17:106-107)
	táva noun “great tree” (PE17:115)
	tavar (1) noun "wood" (TÁWAR)
	tavar (2), pl. tavarni, noun "dale-sprites" (LT1:267; perhaps obsoleted by # 1 above)
	#tavárëa ?adj. *"wooden" (tauretavárëa = *"forest-wooden"?) (TI:415). If so perhaps a near-synonym of taurina.
	Tavari pl. noun (name of the "fays of the Woods" in early "Qenya"; see The Book of Lost Tales 1 p. 267) (TÁWAR)
	tavaril noun "dryad, spirit of woods" (evidently fem.) (TÁWAR)
	tavaro, tavaron noun "dryad, spirit of woods" (evidently masc.) (TÁWAR)
	tavas noun "woodland" (LT1:267)
	taxë ("ks") noun "nail" (TAK)
	te pron. "they, them", 3rd person pl. (VT49:51, LotR3:VI ch. 4, translated in Letters:308). The pronoun te represents an original stem-form (VT49:50). Dative ten, téna or tien “for them, to them” (q.v.) Stressed té (VT49:51). Ótë *"with them", q.v. VT43:20 connects te "them" with a discussion of Common Eldarin pronominal stems (ca. 1940s), where te is the "personal" 3rd person pl. stem, referring to persons rather than abstracts or inanimates (which are denoted by ta instead; see, however, the entry ta #3 regarding the problems with this form, and the hints that te may possibly be used with reference to inanimates as well)). Also consider the reflexive pronoun intë *"themselves", the final element of which is apparently this pronoun te; see also tú for the dual form. 
	tëa (1) noun "straight line, road" (TEÑ)
tëa (2) vb. "indicates" (evidently a present-tense stem) (VT39:6); past tense tengë (VT43:38)
	tec- vb. "write" (Etym gives the form tecë "writes", evidently the 3rd person aorist) (TEK)
	tecco ("k") noun "stroke of pen or brush (´) when not used as long mark" (TEK)
	tecil ("k") noun "pen" (TEK, PM:318, VT47:8)
	tehta noun "mark, sign" (TEK, VT39:17, Appendix E), especially diacritics denoting vowels in Fëanorian writing (pl. tehtar is attested); these diacritics are explicitly called ómatehtar "vowel-marks", q.v.
	*tehtelë noun “scriptures, documents” (updated from “Qenya” tektele) (QL:90)
	tel noun "roof" (LT1:268). Rather tópa in Tolkien’s later Quenya.
	telar noun "brick" (PE13:153, PE16:138)
	telco noun "stem" of a Tengwa symbol (Appendix E). The Etymologies gives telco ("k") pl. telqui ("q") "leg" (the pl. form is said to be analogical) (TÉLEK). It seems, then, that the word can refer to a "stem" or "leg" in general as well as the stem of a Tengwa. In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, telco is used to refer to a carrier symbol (VT46:18, 33)
	Telcontar masc. name "Strider" (MR:216). This word may suggest a verb *telconta- "to stride".
	telda (1) adj. "last, final" (WJ:407)
	telda (2) adj. "having a roof" (LT1:268, LT2:348; this "Qenya" word is perhaps obsoleted by #1 above)
	telë- vb. "finish, end" (intransitive), also "be the last thing or person in a series or sequence of events" (WJ:411; telë may be taken as the 3rd person aorist of a stem tel-, though it may also be interpreted as an example of an E-stem verb, as suggested by the final hyphen)soleted by # 1 above)
	telella adj. corresponding to Telellë (LT1:267)
	Telellë noun "little elf" (also Teler); the Telelli are said to be "young Elves of all clans who dwelt in Kôr to perfect their arts of singing and poetry" (LT1:267; see Teler)
	Telellië noun "Teler-folk" (TELES); this is Teler + lië
	Telemmaitë masc. name, *"Silver-handed" (Appendix A)
	telemna adj. "of silver" (KYELEP/TELEP). Possibly this (like telpina and perhaps telepsa) describes something actually made of the metal silver, whereas telepta (q.v.) only refers to silver colour.%
	Telemnar masc.name, "Silver-flame" (Appendix A; for *Telep-nar)
telempë noun "silver" (LT1:268; in Tolkien's later Quenya telpë, which is actually also found in early "Qenya")
	telep- see telpë
	telepsa adj. "of silver" (KYELEP/TELEP). 
	telepta adj. "silver" (as adj.: silvery) (LT2:347), used as noun in the phrase mi telepta of someone clad “in silver”, where the context (involving other colour-words) shows that this adj. describes something of silver colour (PE17:71). Compare telemna, telepsa, telpina.
	Teler noun "sea-elf", pl. Teleri, general (partitive) pl. Telelli, the third tribe of the Eldar (TELES (MIS) ), also called Lindar. Teleri means "those at the end of the line, the hindmost", (WJ:382 cf. 371), derived from the stem tel- "finish, end, be last" (SA:tel-). The Lindar were so called because they lagged behind on the march from Cuiviénen. In early "Qenya", Teler, also Telellë, was defined "little elf" (LT1:267), but this is hardly a valid gloss in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	telerëa adj. corresponding to Teler (LT1:267; perhaps rather Telerin, telerinwa in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Telerin adj. "Telerian" (TELES). Also telerinwa. 
	telerinwa adj. Telerin (paraphrased "of the Shores of Elfland" in MC:215, since the Teleri dwelt on the shores of the Blessed Realm.) (PE16:96, MC:216)
	Telimbectar ("k") noun, name of constellation: "Orion", lit. "Swordsman of Heaven". Also Telimectar ("k"). (LT1:268; in Tolkien's later Quenya Telumehtar, q.v. The combination ct is not found in LotR-style Quenya.)
	telimbo noun "canopy, sky" (LT1:268)
	Telimectar ("k") noun, name of constellation, "Orion", lit. "Swordsman of Heaven". Also Telimbectar ("k"). (LT1:268; in Tolkien's later Quenya Telumehtar)
	tella adj. "hindmost, last" (TELES)
	tellë noun "rear" (TELES)
	telluma noun "dome, copula", especially the "Dome of Varda" over Valinor, but also applied to the domes of the mansion of Manwë and Varda upon Taniquetil. Adopted from Valarin delgūmā under the influence of pure Quenya telumë (WJ:399, 411). Pl. tellumar is attested (Nam, RGEO:66).
	telma noun "a conclusion, anything used to finish off a work or affair", often applied to the last item in a structure, such as a coping-stone, or a topmost pinnacle (WJ:411). Notice that the form telmanna in the entry TEL/TELU in the Etymologies is a misreading for talmanna (VT46:18) and therefore not the same word as telma.
	telmë noun "hood, covering" (apparently emended from telma, VT46:18); ablative in the phrase telmello talmanna "from hood to base, from crown to foot, top to bottom" (TEL/TELU; the form telmello telmanna occurring in the Etymologies as printed in LR is a typo, VT46:18)
	telpë noun "silver" (in one example with generalized meaning “money”, PE14:54), telep- in some compounds like Teleporno; assimilated telem- in Telemnar and the adj. telemna (KYELEP/TELEP, SA:celeb, LT1:255, 268; also tyelpë, telep-, UT:266). The true Quenya descendant of primitive ¤kyelepē is tyelpë, but the Telerin form telpë was more common, "for the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor" (UT:266). In various names: Telperion the White Tree of Valinor; Telperien ("Telperiën"), fem. name including telp- "silver" (Appendix A); Telperinquar "Silver-fist, Celebrimbor" (SA:celeb - also Tyelperinquar); Telporno, Teleporno "Silver-high" = Sindarin Celeborn (Letters:347, UT:266). It seems that Teleporno is properly Telerin, Quenyarized as Telporno. – Compare adjectives telemna, telpina, telepsa, telepta (q.v.)
	telpina adj. "of silver" (KYELEP/TELEP). Compare telemna, telepta. 
	telqui ("q") noun (analogical) pl. of telco (TÉLEK)
	telta- vb. "to canopy, overshadow, screen" (TEL/TELU)
teltassë noun "awning" (GL:70)
	Telufinwë noun "Last Finwë", masc. name; he was called Amras in Sindarin. Short Quenya name Telvo. (PM:353)
	telumë noun "dome, roof, canopy" (TEL/TELU, WJ:411 cf. 399; see also telluma); "firmament" (MC:214), inflected telumen in MC:221 (the latter is "Qenya"). Telumehtar "warrior of the sky", older name of Menelmacar = Orion (Appendix E, TEL/TELU, WJ:411); Telumendil *"Sky-friend", name of a constellation (Silm)
	telya- vb. "finish, wind up, conclude" (transitive) (WJ:411)
	téma noun "row, series, line" (pl. témar attested) (TEÑ, Appendix E)
	ten (1) pron. in dative “to them, for them” (VT49:14), also tien, téna. See te.
	ten (2) conj. "for", in Fíriel's Song; apparently replaced by an in LotR-style Quenya.
	[ten- (3) vb. “go as far as”, 1st person sg. aorist tenin, (tenin coaryanna “I arrive at [or come/get to] his house”), endingless aorist tenë, present tense téna- “is on point of arrival, is just coming to an end”, past tense tennë “arrived, reached”, in this tense usually with locative rather than allative: tennen sís “I arrive[d] here”, perfect eténië “has just arrived”, future tenuva “will arrive”.] (VT49:23, 35, 36; Tolkien emended the initial consonant from t to m throughout)
	ten- (4) vb. "hear", future tense tenuva (MC:213; in Tolkien's later Quenya, "hear" is hlar-)
	téna (1) adj. "straight, right" (SD:310; see téra)
	téna (2) dative pron. “to them”, changed to ten in the source (VT49:14)
	tencelë ("k") noun "writing system, spelling" (TEK)
tengë pa.t. vb. "indicated", pa.t. of tëa (VT39:6)
	tengwa (pl. tengwar is attested) (1) noun "letter" Tengwa (ñ) is defined as "any one visible sign representing (theoretically) any one audible teñgwe" (phoneme) (VT39:17). In non-technical usage tengwa was equivalent to "consonant", since only the consonants were full signs (WJ:396, TEK). In the Etymologies, tengwa was apparently emended from tengwë (VT46:17).
	tengwa- (2) vb. “to read written matter”, called a “weak verb”; aorist [teng]wa “reads”, present tense [teng]wëa “is reading”, past tense [teng]wane “read”, perfect e[teng]wië “has read”, the latter without lengthening of the stem-vowel (not **eténgwië) because there is a consonant cluster following (VT49:55). Gerund or “verbal noun” tengwië, also attested with a pronominal suffix + genitive: tengwiesto “of your (dual) reading” (VT49:47, 48, 52, 54)
	tengwanda noun "alphabet" (TEK)
	tengwë (pl. tengwi attested) noun "indication, sign, token", in linguistics used for phonemes (VT39:7, WJ:394); hloníti tengwi "phonetic signs" (WJ:395). The term tengwë was particularly associated with consonants (VT39:16). In the Etymologies, stem TEK, tengwë is glossed "writing"; this gloss would seem to be obsolete (for this meaning the word sarmë occurs in Tolkien's later material).
tengwelë noun "Language" (in all its aspects), a general word for the grouping and composing of tengwi (linguistic "signs", phonemes) into a linguistic system (VT39:16)
	tengwesta ("ñ") noun "a system or code of signs", "Language", referring particularly to structure, including morphology and grammar (VT39:15). As a technical term for "language", this includes languages not made up of sounds (WJ:394), but usually it means "spoken language" when unqualified (WJ:395). In the Etymologies, tengwesta is glossed "grammar" (TEK).
	tengwestië noun "Language" as abstract or phenomenon (WJ:394)
	#tengwië noun "language" in the compound mátengwië "language of the hands" (VT47:9). Compare tengwë, tengwesta.
	tenna prep. "until, up to, as far as" (CO), "unto" (VT44:35-36), “to the point”, “right up to a point” (of time/place), “until”, “to the object, up to, to (reach), as far as” (VT49:22, 23, 24, PE17:187), elided tenn' in the phrase tenn' Ambar-metta "unto the ending of the world" in EO, because the next word begins in a similar vowel; cf. tennoio "for ever" (tenna + oio, q.v.) The unelided form appears in PE17:105: Tenna Ambar-metta. 
	tennë, pa.t. of tenya-, q.v.
	tennoio adv. “for ever” (CO); see tenna
	tenta- vb. “point to, point out; indicate; direct toward, be directed toward” (VT49:22-24). Compare hententa-, leptenta-, q.v. When constructed with a direct object, the verb may mean “go forth towards”. In our examples, tenta is constructed with an allative (tentanë numenna “pointed westward”, VT49:23; this may be the normal construction when the meaning is “point”). Pa.t. tentanë is attested (also with ending -s: tentanes “it pointed”, VT49:26); there is also an alternative strong pa.t. form tenantë (VT49:22-23). Other examples of such double past tense forms (e.g. orta-) would suggest that the form tentanë is transitive (“pointed to/out, directed towards, went forth towards”), while tenantë is intransitive (“was directed towards”). – Tolkien also considered the pa.t. form tentë, but emended it.
	†tenya- vb. “arrive” (end at [?specific] place; Tolkien’s gloss was not certainly legible); pa.t. tennë (VT49:24)
	ter (1), also terë, prep. "through", *“throughout” (Notes on CO, UT:317, TER/TERES, Narqelion, VT44:33, 35, VT49:41, 42). The preposition is used both with spatial and temporal reference: ter i·aldar *“through the trees” (Narqelion, cf. VT49:42), ter coivierya *“throughout his/her life”, ter yénion yéni *“through years of years” (VT49:42, VT44:33, 35)
	ter (2), also tér, prep. (?)  ephemeral word for "so" (see ier), abandoned by Tolkien in favour of tambë (VT43:17)
	téra adj. "straight, right" (TEÑ, see TE3; LR:47; in one text Tolkien changed it to téna, SD:310)
	tercáno noun "herald" (PM:362)
	tercen ("k") noun "insight", literally *"through-sight" (MR:471); adj. #tercenya (only pl. tercenyë attested) "of insight"; essi tercenyë "names of insight", names given to a child by its mother, indicating some dominant feature of its nature as perceived by her (MR:216)
	teren, terenë adj. "slender" (TER/TERES)
	Terendul masc. name "Slender-(and)-dark" (LR:59, TER/TERES, DUL, NDUL)
	teret noun "auger, gimlet" (LT1:255)
	tereva adj. "fine, acute" (TER/TERES), "piercing" (LT1:255; though glossed "fine, acute" in the Etymologies, the stem TER is defined as "pierce")
	terfantië noun "temptation" (VT43:9, 22); Tolkien may have abandoned this form in favour of úsahtië, q.v.
	#terpellië noun "temptation" (allative terpellienna attested, VT43:8, 9); Tolkien may have abandoned this form in favour of úsahtië, q.v.
	terhat- vb. "break apart" (SKAT), past tense terhantë "broke" (LR:47/56)
	termar- vb. "stand" meaning last (ter-mar- "through-abide"); future tense termaruva in CO.
	terra noun "fine pierced hole" (VT46:18)
	[tet, see tú]
	-tes ending for dual "short locative" (the exact function of the case is uncertain) (Plotz)
	tevë- vb. "to hate" (LT1:268; in Tolkien's later Quenya, tevë may be understood as the 3rd person aorist, unless this is to be an E-stem verb.)
	tévië noun "hatred" (LT1:268; according to QL:90 the first vowel should be long)
	tevin adj. "hated" (QL:90, not to be glossed "hatred" as in LT1:268)
	†Thauron (þauron) masc. name, earlier form of Sauron, before the change th > s (SA:thaur, cf. Letters:380, which suggests a stem θaurond-; the initial Greek letter represents th). See Sauro, Sauron.
	†thelma (þelma) see *selma

	†thúlë (þúlë) archaic/Vanyarin form of súlë, q.v.
	tië noun "path, course, line, direction, way" (TE3, VT47:11); pl. tier in Namárië (Nam, RGEO:67); tielyanna "upon your path" (UT:22 cf. 51; tie-lya-nna "path-your-upon")
	tien would seem to be a dative pronoun *"for them". Whether this is somehow to be derived from the pronoun te "they, them", or whether it is the dative form of an otherwise unattested 3rd person pl. pronoun *tië, remains unclear. (VT43:12, 21) Ten (q.v.) as the straightforward dative form of te is attested elsewhere.
	tier is, besides the pl. form of tië "path" above, an ephemeral word for "so", abandoned by Tolkien in favour of tambë (VT43:17)
	tihta- vb. "blink, peer", participle tihtala in an earlier variant of Markirya
	tildë noun "spike, horn" (TIL; in the Etymologies as printed in LR, the first gloss is quoted as "point", but according to VT46:19, the proper reading is "spike")
	tillë (pl. tilli given) noun "tip, point", used with reference to fingers and toes (VT47:10, 26); compare ortil, nútil, q.v.
	Tilion masc. name, "the Horned", name of a Maia, steersman of the Moon (SA:til; according to the Etymologies, stem TIL, Tilion is a name of the "man in the Moon")
	timbarë noun "forehead" (PE14:117)
	timpë noun "fine rain" (LT1:268, Narqelion)
	timpinë noun "spray" (LT1:268)
	timpinen noun "a fluter" (LT1:268; hardly valid in Tolkien's later Quenya, where this would look like an instrumental form. Compare simpetar.)
	tin- vb. "glint, spark, glitter" (3rd pers. aorist tinë "it glints") (TIN, PE17:69)
	tinco noun "metal" (TINKŌ), also name of tengwa #1 (Appendix E, there spelt "tinco", but "tinko" in Etym); tincotéma noun "t-series", dental series,  first column of the Tengwar system (Appendix E)
	tinda (1) adj. "glinting, silver" (TIN)
	tinda (2) noun "spike" (LT1:258; probably obsoleted by # 1 above)
	tindë noun "glint" (TIN)
	tindómë noun "starry twilight, starlit dusk" (DOMO, TIN, SA:tin), usually of the time near dawn, not near evening (SA:tin)
	tindómerel (also capitalized Tindómerel) fem. name "daughter of twilight", a kenning (poetic name) of the nightingale; = Sindarin Tinúviel. (TIN, SEL-D, SA:tin; "Tindómrl" in mirrored Tengwar in VT47:37 would seem to be an incomplete annotation of the same word). The form Tindómiel (UT:210) could well be an alternative Quenya equivalent of Tinúviel, and it is possibly to be preferred because the status of the ending -rel "daughter" is uncertain (it was to represent older -zel, -sel corresponding to the independent word seldë, but Tolkien changed the meaning of this word from "daughter" to "child", and since the word for "child" appears as hína in later texts, it may be that seldë and the corresponding ending -rel were dropped altogether). 
	Tindómiel, fem. name (UT:210), probably *"daughter of twilight" (tindómë + -iel) and thus the equivalent of Sindarin Tinúviel. Compare tindómerel.
	tindon pa.t. vb? "lay" (???) (MC:220; this is "Qenya")
	tínë participle? "shining" (MC:213; this is "Qenya") 
	tinga- vb. (not glossed, evidently meaning *"to twang, make a twang") (TING/TANG)
	tingë noun "twang" (TING/TANG)
	tingilindë noun "a twinkling star" (TIN, VT45:15)
	tingilya noun "a twinkling star" (TIN), also divided ting-ilya (VT45:15)
	tinta- vb. "kindle, cause to sparkle", cf. Tintallë (TIN, SA:tin, MR:388)
	Tintallë noun "Kindler", a title of Varda who kindled the stars (TIN, Nam, RGEO:67). From tinta- "kindle, make to sparkle" (MR:388). According to PE17:69, the form “should be Tintalde”, apparently because -llë was at the time the ending for plural “you” and Tintallë could be taken as meaning *”you kindle” rather than as a noun “Kindler”. However, Tolkien later changed the pronominal suffix, eliminating the clash of forms while leaving Tintallë correct (after the revision, it was *tintaldë itself that would be the verb “you kindle”).
	Tintanië noun "Kindler" = Varda (TIN; Tintánië under TAN, which according to VT46:17 Tolkien interpreted both as "Star-maker" and "Star-making")
	tintila- vb. "twinkle", present (or maybe rather aorist) pl. tintilar (Nam, RGEO:67)
	tintina- vb. "sparkle" (actually glossed "it sparkles") (TIN)
	tinwë noun "spark" (gloss misquoted as "sparkle" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, see VT46:19), also "star"; pl. tinwi "sparks", properly used of the star-imagines on Nur-menel (q.v.). Cf. nillë. (TIN, MR:388) In early "Qenya", tinwë was simply glossed "star" (LT1:269, cf. MC:214). In one late source, the meaning of tinwë is given as "spark", and it is said that this word (like Sindarin gil) was used of the stars of heaven "in place of the older and more elevated el, elen- stem" (VT42:11).
	tinwelindon similative noun "like stars" (MC:213, MC:220; this is a "Qenya" similative form in -ndon and with pl. in -li)
	Tinwerína adj. used as noun: place-name "Star-crowned", variant of Elerrína as a name of Taniquetil (RIG, PE17:182)
	[Tinwerontar] noun "star-queen, title of Varda" (TIN, TĀ/TA3) 
	[Tinwetar] noun "star-queen, Queen of Stars", title of Varda (TIN, TĀ/TA3) 
	tir- vb. "watch, watch over, guard, heed", 1st pers. aorist tirin "I watch", pa.t. tirnë (TIR), imperative tira (VT47:31) or á tirë (PE17:94), future tense tiruva "shall heed" in Markirya (also MC:213, 214); also in CO with pronominal endings: tiruvantes "they will guard it" (tir-uva-nte-s "guard-will-they-it"). The stem also occurs in palantíri (q.v.), Tirion place-name "Great Watchtower", a city of the Elves (SA:tir; in MR:176 the translation is "Watchful City")
	tirin noun "tall tower" (LT1:258; this is a verb "I watch" in the Etymologies, stem TIR.)
tirion noun "watch-tower, tower" (TIR); in early "Qenya" the gloss was "a mighty tower, a city on a hill" (LT1:258). Tirion "Great Watchtower", a city of the Elves in the Blessed Realm (SA:tir; in MR:176 the translation is "Watchful City")
	tirios noun (probably *tiriost-) "a town with walls and towers" (LT1:258)
	tiris (tiriss-), also tirissë, noun "watch, vigil" (LT1:258, QL:93)
	titta adj. "little, tiny" (TIT)
	tiuca adj. ("k") "thick, fat" (TIW)
	tiuco noun ("k") "thigh" (TIW)
	tiuta- vb. "comfort, console" (QL:93; as for an obsolete meaning of tiuta-, see tiuya-)
	tiutalë noun "comfort, consolation, easement" (QL:93)
	tiuya- vb. "swell, grow fat" (TIW; emended by Tolkien from tiuta-, VT46:19)
	tixë ("ks") noun "dot, tiny mark, point" (TIK)
	-to ending for dual genitive (Plotz)
	tó 1) noun "wool" (TOW)
	tó 2) adv. “thence” (for *tao, the pronoun ta “that, it” with the genitive ending -o, here used in an ablativic sense). Also talo, with -lo as a short form of the ablative ending -llo. (VT49:29, 11)
	toa (1) ("töa") noun "wood" (VT39:6), “wood as material” (PE17:115)
	toa (2) adj. "of wool, woollen" (TOW; in GL:71 toa was glossed "wool", noun instead of adjective; but in Tolkien's later Quenya, the noun is tó)
	tocot ("k") noun “cock” (PE16:132)
	toi pron. "they" (FS; replaced by te in LotR-style Quenya?)
	toina adj.? “wood – of material” (PE17:115). Since -ina is normally an adjectival ending, the word is best understood as meaning “(made) of wood”. 
	tol noun "island, isle" (rising with sheer sides from the sea or from the river, SA:tol, VT47:26). In early "Qenya", the word was defined as "island, any rise standing alone in water, plain of green, etc" (LT1:269). The stem is toll-; the Etymologies as published in LR gives the pl. "tolle" (TOL2), but this is a misreading for tolli (see VT46:19 and compare LT1:85). The primitive form of tol is variously cited as ¤tolla (VT47:26) and ¤tollo (TOL2).
	Tol Eressëa place-name "Lonely Isle" (LONO, Silm), “Solitary Isle” (Letters:386), also spelt Tol-Eressëa (ERE), Tol-eressëa (TOL2)
	tolbo noun "big toe" (VT47:10), "a stump, stub (as of a truncated arm or branch)" (VT47:28). Since it is elsewhere implied that the commonest form of Quenya shows lv for lb, the form *tolvo may also be usual. Compare tolmo.
toldëa oridinal "eighth" (VT42:25), also toltëa (VT42:31). See tolto.
toldo, see tolto
	tólë noun "centre" (LT1:269; the word endë is to be preferred in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	tollalinta noun in allative "upon hills" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	tollanta noun in allative "upon top(s?)" (MC:221; this is "Qenya")
	tollë noun "a steep isle". Another meaning, "thumb", was apparently abandoned by Tolkien (VT47:13, 26)
	tollo, variant of tolyo, q.v. (VT48:6, 16)
	tolma noun "a protuberance contrived to serve a purpose, knob, short rounded handle", etc. (VT47:28)
tolmen noun "boss (of shield)" (LT1:269)
[tolmo noun "thumb", rejected by Tolkien in favour of nápo (VT48:15)]
	toloquë ("kw") cardinal "eighteen" (VT48:21). If "tolokwe" is seen as a Common Eldarin form, it is possible that the Quenya word should be *tolquë instead, but the editor assumes that "tolokwe" is merely an unusual spelling of Quenya toloquë (since "tolokwe" is listed together with forms that are definitely Quenya).
	tolos noun "knob, lump" (LT1:269; this "Qenya" form would seem to be a precursor of Quenya tolma, q.v.)
	tolosta fraction "one eighth" (1/8). Also tolsat, tosta. (VT48:11)
	tolpë noun "thumb" (VT47:28, VT48:8), a form Tolkien may have rejected in favour of nápo, q.v.
	tolpo noun “bowl” (PE16:142)
	tomba, also tompë, noun “voice / vowel”; the stem TOM is used of sounds “briefer” than the corresponding stem OM (cf. óma). (PE17:138)
	tolsat fraction "one eighth" (1/8). Also tolosta, tosta. (VT48:11)
toltëa ordinal "eighth" (VT42:31), also toldëa (VT42:25). See tolto.
[toltil noun "thumb" (VT47:26)]
tolto cardinal "eight" (TOL1-OTH/OT), variant toldo (VT48:6). Ordinal toltëa "eighth" (VT42:31), with variant toldëa (VT42:25) to go with toldo.
tolu- vb. “roll up” (QL:94)
*tolvo, see tolbo
tolyo noun "sticker-up", "prominent one", term used in children's play for "middle finger" or "middle toe" (VT47:10, VT48:4). The form tollo in VT48:6, 16 would seem to be a variant.
	tombo noun "gong" (LT1:269)
	tompë (1) pa.t. of top- (topë), q.v. (TOP), (2) variant of tomba, q.v.
	top- vb. "cover" (1st pers. aorist topë "covers"), pa.t. tompë (TOP). Variant tup-, q.v.
	tópa noun "roof" (TOP)
tópa- vb. "roof" (TOP)
[tóquet- vb. ”answer” (PE17:166)]
	[Tormen] noun "north" (MEN; replaced by Formen, q.v.)
	#torna adj. “hard”, as in tornanga (q.v.), seemingly -storna after prefixes ending in a vowel, as in the comparative forms aristorna, anastorna (PE17:56; the forms are untranslated and may not necessarily be the same adjective “hard”.)
	tornanga adj. “iron hard” (the order of the elements is the opposite in Quenya). (PE17:56)
	torni pl. of toron (TOR)
	toron (torn- as in pl. torni) noun "brother" (TOR; a later source gives háno, hanno [q.v.] as the word for "brother", leaving the status of toron uncertain)
	torwa ??? (Narqelion)
	tosta fraction "one eighth" (1/8). Also tolosta, tolsat (VT48:11)
	-tsë, dual locative ending (Plotz); see -ssë
	-ttë (1) “they”, dual 3rd person pronominal ending (“the two of them”) (VT49:51), replacing (also within the legendarium) the older ending -stë (which was later used for the second person only). This older ending -stë corresponds to a possessive ending -sta “their” (VT49:16), but this was presumably likewise altered to *-tta as the new ending for dual “their” = “of the two of them”.
	-ttë (2), 3rd person pl. reflexive ending, as in melittë “they love themselves” (VT49:21). This ending can hardly coexist with #1 above; an alternative wording would be the analytical construction *meliltë intë. Compare -ssë #2. 
	tú pron. “they, them”, 3rd person dual (“the two of them”), both “personal and neuter” (the pronoun can be used of persons and things alike). (VT49:51) Tolkien also considered tet for the same meaning, listing it alongside tú in one source (VT49:56), but this form was apparently abandoned.
	tuc- ("k") noun "draw" (1st pers. aorist tucin "I draw") (TUK)
	tucalia ("k") ??? (Narqelion)
	tuia- vb. "sprout, spring" (Tolkien's gloss is actually "sprouts, springs", since tuia is also the 3rd pers. sg. present tense [or aorist]) (TUY)
	tuilë noun "spring, spring-time", also used = "dayspring, early morn" (VT39:7, TUY), in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 54 days, but also used without any exact definition. Cf. tuilérë, q.v. (Appendix D) - In early "Qenya", the word tuilë is glossed "Spring", but it is said that it literally refers to a "budding", also used collectively for "buds, new shoots, fresh green" (LT1:269). Cf. tuima in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	tuilérë noun *"Spring-day", a day outside the months in the Steward's Reckoning, inserted between Súlimë and Víressë (rough equivalents of March and April). In Tolkien's early "Qenya", Tuilérë was simply glossed "Spring" (LT1:269).
	tuilindo noun "swallow", etymologically "spring-singer" (TUY, LIN2, LT1:269, LT2:338)
	tuima noun "sprout, bud" (TUY)
	tul- vb. "come" (WJ:368), 1st pers. aorist tulin "I come" (TUL), 3rd pers. sg. tulis “(s)he comes” (VT49:19), perfect utúlië "has come" (utúlien "I am come", EO), utúlie'n aurë "Day has come" (the function of the 'n is unclear; it may be a variant of the article "the", hence literally "the Day has come"). Past tense túlë "came" in LR:47 and SD:246, though an alternative form *tullë has also been theorized. Túlë in VT43:14 seems to be an abnormal aorist stem, later abandoned; tula in the same source would be an imperative. Prefixed future tense entuluva "shall come again" in the Silmarillion, future tuluva also in the phrase aranielya na tuluva "may thy kingdom come" (VT44:32/34), literally apparently *"thy kingdom, be-it-that (it) will come". In early "Qenya" we have the perfects tulielto "they have come" (LT1:114, 270, VT49:57) and tulier "have come", pl., in the phrase I·Eldar tulier "the Eldar have come"(LT1:114, 270). Read probably *utúlieltë, *Eldar utúlier in LotR-style Quenya. 
	tulca (1) ("k") adj. "firm, strong, immovable, steadfast" (TULUK)
tulca- (2) ("k") vb. "fix, set up, establish" (LT1:270)
	tulca (3) ("k") adj. "yellow". Adopted and adapted from Valarin; the normal Quenya word for "yellow" is rather malina (WJ:399) 
	tulco ("k") noun "support, prop". Given the primitive form ¤tulku, the word would have the stem-form *tulcu- and the plural form *tulqui. (TULUK)
Tulkas (Tulkass-, as in dat.sg. Tulkassen) masc. name, used of a Vala, adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:399, TULUK)
	tulma noun "bier" (LT1:270)
	tulta- vb. "send for, fetch, summon" (TUL). Tultanelyes *"you summoned him", changed by Tolkien to leltanelyes *"you sent him" (possibly tulta- was meant to have the meaning "send" here, but Tolkien decided to use another word) (VT47:22)
	tulu- vb. "fetch, bring, bear; move, come" (LT1:270; compare tulta- in Tolkien's later Quenya) 
	tulunca ("k") adj. "steady, firm" (LT1:270; in Tolkien's later Quenya tulca)
	tulwë noun "pillar, standard, pole" (LT1:270)
	tulya- vb. "lead" (+ allative: lead into) (VT43:22)
	túma adj.? "moving" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	tumba noun "deep valley" (Letters:308; SA:tum and TUB gives tumbo "valley, deep valley"); apparently an extended form *tumbalë in tumbalemorna "deepvalleyblack" or (according to SA:tum) "black deep valley", also tumbaletaurëa "deepvalleyforested"; see Taurelilómëa-tumbalemorna... 
	tumbë noun "trumpet" (LT1:269)
tumbo (stem *tumbu-, given the primitive form ¤tumbu) noun "(deep) valley", under or among hills (TUB, SA:tum), “depth” (PE17:81). - In early "Qenya", the gloss was "dark vale" (LT1:269). See tumba.
	Tumbolatsin noun (place-name, apparently incorporating tumbo) (LAT)
	tumna adj. "lowlying, deep, low" (TUB); early "Qenya" glosses: "deep, profound, dark or hidden" (LT1:269, 271) 
	tumpo (stem *tumpu-, given the primitive form ¤tumpu) noun "hump" (TUMPU)
	Túna (also Tún) place-name, used of the hill on which Tirion was built (Silm, TUN, KOR), derived from a stem (TUN) apparently meaning simply *"hill, mound".
	tunda adj. "tall" (TUN)
	tunda- vb. "kindle" (LT1:270; rather tinta- or narta- in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	tundo noun "hill, mound" (TUN)
	túnë, pa.t. of tunta-
	tunga adj. "taut, tight" (of strings:) "resonant" (TUG)
	tunta- “see, notice, perceive”, pa.t. túne (QL:95)
	tuo noun "muscle, sinew, vigour, physical strength" (TUG)
	#tup- vb. "cover", isolated from untúpa, q.v. Variant top- in the Etymologies.
	tupsë noun "thatch" (TUP)
	tur- vb. "wield, control, govern" (1st pers. aorist turin "I wield" etc.), pa.t. turnë (TUR). The verb is elsewhere defined “master, conquer, win” (PE17:115), virtually the same meanings are elsewhere assigned to turu- #1, q.v.
	túr, tur noun "king" (PE16:138, LT1:260); rather aran in LotR-style Quenya, but cf. the verb tur-. Also compare the final element -tur, -ntur "lord" in names like Axantur, Falastur, Fëanturi, Vëantur (q.v.)
	túra adj. “big, great” (PE17:115), related to words for power and apparently referring to a more abstract greatness than words like haura “huge”. Cf. taura, túrëa. Apparently initial element of Túrosto.
Turambar masc. name, "Master of Doom/Fate", name taken in pride by Túrin (Appendix A, SA:tur, TUR, MBARAT, VT49:42)
	Turcafinwë masc. name, "strong, powerful (in body) Finwë", masc. name; he was called Celegorm in Sindarin. Short Quenya name Turco. (PM:352), compare #turco "chief" (q.v.)
	Turcil ("k") noun "Númenórean" (TUR), stem turcild- as in pl. turcildi (LR:47, 56; SD:246). Variant of Tarcil; see VT46:17.
	#turco (1) noun "chief" (isolated from Turcomund "chief bull", Letters:423). Turco, masc. name, see Turcafinwë.
	turco (“k”) (2) noun “tower”. In Lúnaturco, Quenya name of Barad-dûr (Dark Tower). Tolkien changed the word turco from turma (PE17:22).
	túrë noun "mastery, victory" (TUR), "strength, might" (QL:95), "power" (QL:96)
	túrëa adj. “mighty, masterful” (PE17:115), also taura.
	Túrin masc. name, apparently meaning *"victory-mood" (LR:395, s.v. TUR). The Etymologies gives Turindo as the Quenya form of this name; Túrin seems to be properly the Sindarin form, though it fits Quenya style well enough and Nienor used it in a Quenya sentence (near the end of ch. 21 of the Silmarillion). The name appears as Turin (with a short u) in the phrase nahtana ló Turin, *”slain by Túrin” (VT49:24)
	#turinasta, #túrinasta noun "kingdom" (turinastalya, túrinastalya "thy kingdom", VT43:15). These words for "kingdom" Tolkien perhaps abandoned in favour of #aranië, q.v. 
	#turindië, #túrindië noun "kingdom" (turindielya, túrindielya "thy kingdom", VT43:15). These words for "kingdom" Tolkien perhaps abandoned in favour of #aranië, q.v. 
	Turindo masc. name; see Túrin (TUR)
	turinqui ("q") noun "queen" (LT1:260; apparently the fem. of tur. In Tolkien's later Quenya, "queen" is tári.)
	túrion (túriond-) noun “palace” (QL:95)
	turma (1) noun "shield" (TURÚM). 
[turma] (2) noun “tower”. Tolkien changed this word to turco (#2), q.v. (PE17:22)
	turmen noun “realm” (PE17:28). Turmen Follondiéva ”Realm of the North-harbourage”, old name for Arnor, Turmen Hallondiéva “Realm of the South-harbourage”, old name for Gondor (PE17:28)
	turnë pa.t. of tur- (TUR)
	Turondo masc. name “Lord of stone” (PE17:112); see Turucáno. 
	Túrosto place-name "Gabilgathol", a dwelling of the Dwarves (Sindarin Belegost; the names mean "Mickleburg", "Great Fortress"). Apparently túra + osto.
	turu- (1) vb. “master, defeat, have victory over” (PE17:113, not clearly said to be Quenya, but the Q name Turucundo “Victory-prince” is listed immediately afterwards). Compare tur-; cf. also *turúna. 
	turu- (2) vb. "kindle" (a “Qenya” form from LT1:270; rather narta- or tinta- in LotR-style Quenya)
	turu (3) noun "wood" (properly firewood, but used of wood in general) (LT1:270)
	Turucáno ("k") masc. name "Turgon" (PM:344). The meaning is something like “powerful commander” (see cáno). Another version gives Turondo “lord of stone” as the Q name of Turgon(d). (PE17:115), with a wholly distinct final element.
	[Turumbar] masc.name (MBARAT; changed by Tolkien to Turambar)
	turun, see *turúna
	*turúna passive participle "mastered", only attested attested in the elided form turún' (UT:138, apparently incomplete spelling turun in Silm ch. 21). The form may be understood as the passive participle of the verb turu- “master, defeat, have victory over” (PE17:113), the sole available example of a U-stem verb appearing in such a participle form. Compare -na #4. 
	turúva adj. "wooden" (LT1:270); cf. turu #3.
	tussa noun "bush" (TUS)
	tusturë noun "tinder" (LT1:270)
	#tuv- vb. "find", perfect #utúvië "has found" in Aragorn's exclamation when he found the sapling of the White Tree: utúvienyes "I have found it" (utúvie-nye-s "have found-I-it") (LotR3:VI ch. 5) 
tuvu- vb. "receive" (GL:71; is this "Qenya" word related to #tuv- "find"?)
	-twa 1) ending for dual possessive (Plotz)
-twa 2) an pronominal possessive ending mentioned in one chart of pronouns, apparently “their” referring to two persons (VT49:16); this may be an ending used in colloquial Quenya rather than formal language (it is listed together with the endings -ya ”his, her” and -rya “their”, that are explicitly said to belong to colloquial Quenya) (VT49:16-17)
	-tya, pronominal ending, 2nd person sg. intimate/familiar “your, thy” (VT49:16, 38, 48); compare -tyë
	tyal- vb. "play" (1st pers. aorist tyalin "I play") (TYAL)
	tyalangan noun "harp-player" (TYAL)
	tyalië noun "sport, play, game" (TYAL, LT1:260)
	tyar- vb. "cause" (KYAR)
	tyaro noun "doer, actor, agent" (KAR)
	tyasta- vb. "put to the test", pa.t. tyasantë (QL:49)
	tyav- vb. "taste" (1st pers. aorist tyavin "I taste") (KYAB)
	tyávë noun "taste" (pl. #tyáver attested only in the compound lámatyáver, see lámatyávë.) (MR:215, 216). It may be that the verb tyav- would also appear as tyávë in the past tense.
	tye pron. “you, thou, thee”, 2nd person intimate/familar (LR:61, 70, Arct, VT49:36, 55), corresponding to formal/polite lye. According to VT49:51, tye was used as an endearment especially between lovers, and (grand)parents and children also used it to address one another (“to use the adult lye was more stern”). Tyenya “my tye”, used = “dear kinsman” (VT49:51). The pronoun tye is derived from kie, sc. an original stem ki with an added -e (VT49:50). Stressed tyé; dual tyet *“the two of you” (VT49:51 – another note reproduced on the same page however states that tye has no dual form, and VT49:52 likewise states that the 2nd person familiar “never deleloped” dual or plural forms). Compare the reflexive pronoun intyë *"yourself". Possibly related to the pronominal stem KE (2nd person sg.), if tye represents earlier *kye.
-tyë pronominal ending “you, thou” (VT49:48, 51), 2nd person familiar/intimate: carityë *”you do” (VT49:16; the corresponding formal/polite ending is -l, -lyë, cf. PE17:135 where Tolkien states that hiruvalyë “thou shalt find” from Namárië would be hiruvatyë if the polite pronoun were replaced by the familiar one). Compare the independent pronoun tye. In VT49:51, Tolkien denies that the ending -tyë has any short form (see, however, -t # 3). Cf. natyë “you are”; see ná #1. Compare tye, -tya.
tyel (1) noun "end", stem tyeld- as in the pl. form tyeldi (FS, KYEL; the pl. form tyeldi was misread as "tyelde" in the Etymologies as printed in LR; cf. VT45:25 for this correction). Cf. tyelma.
	tyel- (2) vb. "end, cease" (KYEL)
	tyelca ("k") adj. "swift, agile" (KYELEK), "hasty" (PM:353)
	Tyelcormo ("k") masc. name "hasty-riser", the amilessë or mother-name (never used in narrative) of Turcafinwë = Celegorm (PM:353)
	[**tyeldë], see tyel (KYEL)
	tyelima adj. "final" (KYEL)
	tyellë noun "grade" (pl. tyeller is attested) (Appendix E), “grade, order; a step in a stairway, [or in a] ladder” (PE17:122, 157)
	tyelma noun "ending" (FS, VT45:25)
	tyelpë noun "silver" (KYELEP/TELEP), etymology also in Letters:426 and UT:266. Tyelpë is the true Quenya descendant of primitive ¤kyelepē, but the Telerin form telpë was more common, "for the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor" (UT:266). In the Etymologies, tyelpë is also the name of Tengwa #1 with overposed dots, this symbol having the value ty (VT45:25). Cf. tyelpetéma as the name of the entire palatal series of the Tengwar system.
	Tyelperinquar masc. name, "Silver-fist, Celebrimbor" (PM:318; also Telperinqar, q.v.)
	tyelpetéma noun "palatal series" (Appendix E)
	Tyelperion less common name of Telperion (UT:266).
	tyulma noun "mast" (TYUL, SD:419). "Qenya" pl. tyulmin "masts" in MC:216; read *tyulmar in LotR-style Quenya.
	tyulussë noun "poplar-tree" (TYUL)
tyur noun "cheese" (QL:50 cf. GL:28)

<U>
	#u- vb. "not do, not be" (1st pers. aorist uin "I do not, am not"), pa.t. úmë (UGU/UMU). A late (ca. 1968) source gives the forms uin, uin(yë) “I am not”, uil(yë) *”you are not”, uis “it is not”, uilmë *”we are not”, uir “are not” and endingless ui *”is not” (VT49:29, 36); these forms were however struck out. The example uin carë “I don’t” (PE17:68) combines this negative verb with a following verb in the “simplest aorist infinitive”. Compare ua in another late source. See also ui, which (despite its use as an interjection “no”) seems to be the endingless 3rd person aorist.
	ú (1) adv. and prep. "without, destitute of" (VT39:14). Usually followed by genitive: ú calo "without light" (cala). – In one source, ú is seemingly also used as a negative verb “was not” (VT49:13), but Tolkien revised the text in question. 
ú- (2) prefix "not-, un-, in-", denying presence or possession of thing or quality (VT39:14, UGU/UMU/VT46:20, GŪ, LT1:272), or simply suggesting something bad or immoral (see #úcar-, Úmaiar). Tolkien at one point considered redefining ú- as an element signifying "bad, uneasy, hard"; the already-published form únótima would then mean "difficult/impossible to count" rather than simply "uncountable" (VT42:33). However, Tolkien's very last word on the matter seems to be that ú- was to remain a mere negative (VT44:4). Compare úa, q.v. According to the Etymologies, the prefix ú- usually has a "bad sense", whereas according to early material u- (uv-, um-, un-) is a "mere negation" (UGU/UMU vs. VT42:32) According to a later source, ú- could be used as an uninflected verbal prefix, mainly in verse, but in a normal style the prefix was “verbalized” as ua-, q.v. (PE17:144). The stem Ū, as a negation, was accompanied by “pursed lips and shaking of the head” (PE17:145).
ua- negative verb “not do, not be”. If a verb is to be negated, ua (coming before the verb) receives any pronominal endings (and presumably also any endings for plurality or duality, -r or -t), whereas the uninflected tense-stem of the verb follows: With the ending -n for “I”, one can thus have constructions like uan carë *”I do not” (aorist), uan carnë *“I did not” (past), uan cára *“I am not doing” (present), uan caruva *”I shall not do” (future). The verb ua- can itself be fully conjugated: #ua aorist (or present?), únë (past), úva “(future), #uië (perfect) (the aorist and perfect are attested only with the ending -n “I”). In “archaic Quenya” these tense-forms could be combined with an uninflected aorist stem, e.g. future *úvan carë = later Quenya uan caruva, “I shall not do”. In later Quenya, only the forms ua (present or aorist) and “occasionally” the past tense form #únë were used in normal prose (únen *”I did not, was not”). (PE17:144; compare FS for úva as a future-tense negative verb “will not”)
úa, with 1st person suffix úalyë, imperative particle á, a combined with the negation ú- to express a prohibition (úalyë mittanya me, *"do not thou lead us", VT43:9, 21-22). However, Tolkien apparently abandoned úa in favour of ala, alalyë, q.v. (later he also used the form áva for "don't"). Compare ua.
	Úamanyar noun "those not of Aman" (sg. Úamanya, PE17:143), Elves who did not reach the Blessed Realm (but did leave Cuiviénen with the intention of going there) = Heceldi (WJ:371). Also Úmanyar and fuller Úmaneldi. (WJ:373). Also called Lembi, q.v.
	#úcar- vb. "to sin, trespass; to do wrong" (pl. aorist úcarer in VT43:12, we would rather expect *úcarir, a form seemingly indicated by an emendation in one variant of the text in question, VT43:21). The verb is car- "do" with the prefix ú-, here suggesting something morally bad (*"do wrong") rather than simple negation.
	#úcarë noun "debt, trespass" (úcaremmar "our debts, our trespasses", VT43:19). The related words #úcar- “to sin” and #úcarindo “sinner” would suggest that #úcarë can also be translated “sin”. – One may question whether the simplex form is #úcarë or just #úcar (+ -e- as a mere connecting vowel before the pronominal ending in úcaremmar), but compare lacarë, hrúcarë. 
	#úcarindo (pl. úcarindor, VT43:27) noun "sinner"; cf. úcar-. The form úlcarindor occurring in an older variant of the text in question seems abnormal, since Quenya rarely has a long vowel in front of a consonant cluster (VT43:33)
	uë noun "fleece" (LT1:249)
úfantima adj. “not concealable” (PE17:176), also úfantuma (PE17:180), cf. fanta-, q.v.
úfanwa adj. “not veiled or obscure, perspicuous” (PE17:176)
úfanwëa adj. “not veiled, unveiled” (PE17:180), possibly a variant or replacement úfanwa, q.v.
	ufárëa adj. "not enough" (FS). Cf. ú- "un-" and fárëa "enough, sufficient" (read *úfárëa?)
	ui interjection “no” (originally an endingless negative verb in the 3rd person aorist: “it is not [so]”; see #u-). Apparently this is the word for “no” used to deny that something is true (compare vá, which is rather used to reject orders, or to issue negative orders). (VT49:28)  Compare uito.
	#uië, the perfect tense of the negative verb ua-, q.v. Only attested with a 1st person sg. pronominal suffix (uien). 
	uilë noun "long trailing plant", especially "seaweed" (UY)
	uin (1) see #u-.
	Uin (2) masc. name, "the primeval whale" (LT1:263)
	Uinen (Uinend-, as in dative Uinenden) fem. name, used of a Maia, spouse of Ossë (UY, NEN). Adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:404), though it is also said that it contains -nen "water" (SA:nen); the latter explanation may be folk etymology. In the Etymologies, the name is derived from the same stem (UY) as uilë "long trailing plant, especially seaweed".
	uito interjection “it is not that” (emphatic word for “no”?) Compare ui, náto (VT49:28, 29)
úχarin adj. “unmarred” (PE17:150), this would be úharin in more standard spelling (and later pronunciation). In a more widely published source, the word for “unmarred” is alahasta, q.v.
	Úlairi pl. noun "Nazgûl" (sg. *Úlairë? *Úlair?) Etymology obscure.
	Ulban (Ulband-) noun "monster" (a name of Melko) (LT1:260)
	ulca adj. "evil, bad, wicked, wrong" (QL:97, VT43:23-24, VT48:32, VT49:14; compounded in henulca "evileyed", SD:68); variant olca, q.v. Compare noun ulco. The adj. ulca may also itself be used as a noun “evil”, as in the ablative form ulcallo “from evil” (VT43:8, 10) and the sentence cé mo quetë ulca *”if one speaks evil” (VT49:19).
	ulco (stem #ulcu-) noun "evil", pl. *ulqui (VT43:23-24; the stem-form is attested in the ablative case: ulcullo "from evil", VT43:12)
	úlëa adj. "pouring, flooding, flowing" (ULU)
	ullë intr. pa.t. of ulya-, q.v. (ULU). Cf. ullier "poured", a pl. past tense of ulya- "pour" occurring in LR:47; read probably *uller in Tolkien's later Quenya. In SD:247, ullier is translated "should flow".
	ullumë adv.? a word occurring in Fíriel's Song, evidently meaning "not for ever". Cf. ú-, lúmë and úlumë.
	Ulmo masc. name, used of the Vala of all waters (ULU), interpreted "the Pourer" by folk etymology, but the name was actually adopted and adapted from Valarin (WJ:400) 
	ulmula participle "mumbling" (MC:214; this is "Qenya") 
	ulto- vb. "pour" (intransitive?) (LT1:270; in Tolkien's later Quenya ulya- pa.t. ullë)
	ulu- vb. "pour" (transitive?) (LT1:270; in Tolkien's later Quenya ulya- pa.t. ulyanë)
	úlumë adv. “ever”, at all times (in a series or period) (PE17:156). Cf. ullumë.
	ulumpë noun "camel" (QL:97)
	Ulumúri pl. noun, the great horns of Ulmo; etymology obscure (Silm)
	ulundë noun "flood" (ULU), possibly in the sense of (great) river.% Cf. nuinë, oloirë.
	ulundo noun "monster, deformed and hideous creature" (ÚLUG)
	ulya- vb. "pour", intr. pa.t. ullë, tr. ulyanë (ULU). Cf. ullier "poured", a pl. past tense of ulya- occurring in LR:47; read probably *uller in Tolkien's later Quenya. In SD:247, ullier is translated "should flow". 
	#um- vb. "not to do, not to be" (1st pers. aorist umin "I do not, am not"), past tense úmë (UGU/UMU). Another version of this negative verb had the form #hum-, q.v., but Tolkien rejected it.
	úma- vb. "teem" (VT48:32)
	úmaitë adj. “clumsy(-handed), unskilled” (PE17:162)
	Úmaneldi noun *"Non-Aman Elves", Elves who never dwelt in Aman (= Úmanyar) (WJ:373). Sg. #Úmanel, #Úmaneld-.
	Úmanyar pl. noun "those not of Aman", Eldar that did not reach Aman, sc. Sindar and Nandor (SA:mān). Sg. #Úmanya. Also Úamanyar.
	[?umaqualë] ("q"), possibly a synonym of anqualë/unqualë, hence noun "agony, death" (VT45:24)
[umba, umbacarin adj. unknown meaning relating badness (PE17:172)]
	umbar (umbart-, as in dat.sg. umbarten) noun "fate, doom" (MBARAT), also name of tengwa #6 (Appendix E).Cf. Umbarto. In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, umbar was the name of letter #18 (VT45:33), which tengwa Tolkien would later call malta instead – changing its Quenya value from mb to m. – In the word Tarumbar "King of the World" (q.v.), umbar appears to be a variant of Ambar (q.v.) instead.
	Umbardacil masc. name (or title) "Umbar-victor" (Appendix A); the place-name Umbar is not Quenya and has no connection with umbar "fate". 
	umbarta- vb. “to define, decree, destine”; this form of the verb was used “in more lofty senses”, otherwise marta- (PE17:104)
	Umbarto masc. name, "Fated", mother-name (never used in narrative) of Telufinwë = Amras. The ominous name was altered to Ambarto by Fëanor. (PM:353-354)
	umba noun "swarm" (VT48:32)
	umbas (þ) noun "shield" (VT45:33)
	umbo, umbon noun “hill, lump, clump, mass” (PE17:93)
	úmë (1) vb. pa.t. of um- (and u-?), q.v. (UGU/UMU)
	úmë (2) "great collection or crowd of things of same sort" (a struck-out note gave the rejected gloss "largeness") (VT48:32), “throng, great concourse of things without order” (PE17:115). Compare úvë.
	-úmë (3) suffix "large" (of quantity)", as in liyúmë "host" (VT48:32)
	Úmaiar pl. noun, Maiar (see Maia) who became evil and followed Melkor, like the Balrogs (MR:79). Sg. #Úmaia.
	úmëa (1) adj. "abundant, swarming, teeming" (VT48:32), “large” (of throng) (PE17:115). Compare úvëa.
	úmëa (2) adj. "evil" (UGU/UMU). Obsoleted by #1 above? Possibly connected to úmëai in Narqelion, if that is a "Qenya" plural form.
	umnë, see matumnë under mat-
	umpano noun "build" (read: building), alternative form of ampano, which form is probably to be preferred (VT45:36, compare PAN; VT46:8 records how Tolkien in one case altered umpano to ampano)
	un- intensive prefix used before qu; the assimilated variant um- is said to occur before p, and "b" (the latter evidently = v developed from prehistoric b, but following um- its original quality would be preserved so that we would see umb-). This prefix is reportedly only used "in evil sense"; otherwise the intensive prefix is an- (and assimilated variants thereof). (VT45:5)
úna adj. "deprived of, destitute, forlorn" (VT39:14). The plural form *únë is not to be confused with the pa.t. of the negative verb ua, q.v. – An unglossed word úna, cited in VT49:28, rather seems to be a negated form of ná “is”. 
únat noun "a thing impossible to be or to be done" (VT39:26) Cf. ú- and nat.
	unca- ("k") vb. "hollow out" (UNUK)
	Undolaurë masc. name "Glorund" (> Glaurung). Also Laurundo. (LT2:341)
	undómë noun "twilight", usually of the time near evening, not near dawn (that is tindómë)
	undu adv. (and prep.?) "down, under, beneath" (UNU, VT46:20); prefix undu- "down", in undulávë "down-licked" = covered. (Nam) 
undulav- vb., literally “lick down” = cover (glossed “swallow” in PE17:72). Lumbulë undulávë ilyë tier "(heavy) shadow down-licked all paths", lyrical translation "all paths are drowned deep in shadow" (Nam). The pl. past tense would be unduláver (PE17:72).
	undumë noun "abyss" (Markirya)
	#únë vb., the pa.t. of ua-, q.v. Only attested with a 1st person sg. pronominal suffix: únen.
	Úner noun "Noman" (UT:211)
	ungo noun "cloud, dark shadow" (UÑG)
	Ungoliantë fem. name "Ungoliant" (the Spider, ally of Morgoth); also Ungweliantë (UÑG, DYEL, SLIG)
	ungwalë noun "torture" (ÑGWAL)  Also nwalmë in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	ungwë noun "spider's web", also name of tengwa #8 (Appendix E), or, in the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, tengwa #20 – which letter Tolkien would later call nwalmë (VT46:20). The word as such was defined as "gloom" in the Etymologies (UÑG), while in early "Qenya" it meant "spider" ("especially Ungwë the Gloomweaver" = Ungoliant) (LT1:271)
	Ungweliantë fem. name, the Spider, ally of Morgoth (UÑG)
	unotë, unotëa (read *únotë, *únotëa?) adj. "not counted, uncounted" (VT39:14)
únótima adj. "not possible to count, countless" (VT39:14), pl. únótimë (translated "numberless") attested (ú-nót-imë "not-count-able") (Nam, RGEO:66, Appendix E). Cf. unnegated nótima, q.v.
	unqua ("q") adj. "hollow" (UNUK)
	unqualë ("q") noun "agony, death" (KWAL, VT45:36). See anqualë. In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, unqualë was the name of letter #8 (VT45:18), which tengwa Tolkien would later call ungwë instead – changing its Quenya value from nqu to ngw.
	unquë noun "hole, hollow" (VT46:20, UNUK), also name of tengwa #16 (Appendix E; there spelt unque, while the Etymologies has unqe)
	untúpa vb. "down-roofs" = covers (perhaps for *undutúpa-, cf. undu-). Present tense of untup- with lengthening of the stem vowel and the suffix -a (cf. síla "shines" from sil-)
	unuhuinë prep + noun "under-shadow" (LR:47); see huinë.
	unutixë ("ks") noun dot or point placed below the line of writing (TIK). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the initial element unu- was misread was nun- (VT46:19). The variant unutexë ("ks") was rejected by Tolkien (VT46:20)

	úpahtëa adj. “speechless” (synonym of úpa, q.v.) (PE17:126)
	úquétima adj. "unspeakable", sc. impossible to say, put into words; also "unpronounceable" (WJ:370)
	úr noun "fire" (UR) This stem was struck out in Etym, but a word that must be derived from it occurs in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it. Early "Qenya" also has Ûr, noun "the Sun" (also Úri, Úrinci ("k"), Urwen) (LT1:271). Cf. Úri.
	Úr-anar noun, word occurring in Fíriel's Song, translated "the red sun"; actually the prefixed element úr- must have to do with the element ur- "heat, be hot" mentioned in the Silmarillion Appendix. Also compare Ûr as an early Qenya word for "the Sun".
	úra (1) adj. "evil, nasty" (VT43:24, VT48:32)
	úra (2) adj. "large" (UR), probably obsoleted by #1 above
	urcárima, urcarnë adj. “hard to make / do”. (PE17:154). Cf. urucarin.
	urco ("k"), stem *urcu- and pl. urqui, noun: an old word used in the lore of the Blessed Realm for anything that caused fear to the Elves during the March; by the Exiled Noldor the word was recognized as the cognate of Sindarin orch and used to mean "Orc". The Sindarin-influenced form orco was also used. (WJ:390)
	urda adj. “hard, difficult, arduous” (PE17:154)
	urdu noun "death" (LT2:342; rather nuru in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	úrë noun "heat", also name of tengwa #36 (Appendix E)
	úri noun "sun" (MC:214, 221; this is "Qenya"); genitive úrio "sun's" (MC:216)
	Úrimë (in some editions Urimë, but this seems to be an error; cf. úrë "heat") noun, name of the eighth month of the year, "August" (Appendix D, SA:ur-, UT:302)
	úrin adj. "blazing hot" (LT1:271)
	Úrin (Úrind-, as in "g.sg. Úrinden", in LotR-style Quenya this is dat.sg.) noun, a name of the Sun (UR, PE17:148; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it.)
	Úrion (Q?) noun, a title of Fionwë (= later Eönwë); see the LR index. (UR; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it.)
	urna noun "oven" (LT1:271)
	úro noun "evil" (VT43:24); Tolkien may have abandoned this form in favour of ulco, q.v.
	*urta-, see usta-
	ur(u)- prefix denoting difficulty (PE17:154, 172), cf. urcárima, urucarin
	urnótima adj. Unglossed, apparently *”difficult to count” (PE17:172)
	uru noun "fire" (LT1:271)
	urucarin adj. “made with difficulty” (PE17:154)
	uruitë adj. "fiery" (UR; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it.)
	urulócë ("k") noun "fire-dragon" (LOK), pl. Urulóci ("k") (SA:ur-). In the Silmarillion, the word Urulóci is both singular (as when Glaurung is called "the first of the Urulóki", Silm:138) and plural (as when Glaurung is called "the Urulóki", Silm:255).
	Urundil masc. name, "copper-lover" (PM:365); this may suggest #urun as one word for "copper", unless this is the ending -ndil "friend, lover" suffixed to #uru- as a reduced form of urus, q.v. 
	urus (urust-) noun "copper" (VT41:10)
	úruva adj. "fiery" (from UR; this stem was struck out in Etym, but several words that must be derived from it occur in LotR, so it seems that Tolkien restored it. The word úruva also occurred in early "Qenya"; in LT1:271 it is glossed "like fire".)
	uruvoitë adj. "fiery" (LT1:271)
	urwa adj. "on fire" (LT1:271)
	urya- vb. “be hot” (PE17:148), "burn" (intransitive) (LT1:271)

	ursa (þ) vb. “to rage” (PE17:188)
	us- (þ) prefix denoting something bad; cf. uscarë
	#us- vb. "escape" (given in the form usin "he escapes" in LT1:251; this would have to mean "I escape" if the word is to be adopted to Tolkien's later Quenya). Cf. uswë.
	úsahtië (þ) noun "inducement to do wrong" (VT43:23); allative úsahtienna attested (the alternative form úsahtíenna with a long í must be erroneous, as pointed out by the editors [ibid.]). Compare sahta-, sahtië.
	uscarë (þ) noun ”doing wrong” (PE17:151). Also uxarë. Cf. úcarë.
	úsië adv. “on the contrary” (VT49:8, 35). Cf. lasi.
	úsir adv. “on the contrary”, a form Tolkien may have abandoned in favor of úsië (VT49:18)
	usquë ("q") noun "reek" (USUK). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, usquë was also the name of tengwa #16, which at this conceptual stage had the value squ (VT46:20). Later, Tolkien would call this letter unquë, with the value nqu.
	usta- vb. "burn" (transitive) (LT1:271, QL:98). This form reflects the stem USU listed in early material; however, since Tolkien seems to have changed it to UR later, we should perhaps read *urta- for usta-.
	uswë noun "issue, escape" (LT1:251)
	Uswevandë noun "way of escape" (LT2:336)
	utúlien see tul- (EO)
	Utumno (stem *Utumnu-), place-name, the first great stronghold of Melkor in the North (SA:tum, TUB). The etymology apparently has something to do with "very deep" or "very hidden"; the phrase "Utumno the Deep-hidden" in MR:67 may include a rough translation of the name. This later source derives the name from a root meaning "cover over, hide", whereas in Etym it was derived from the root TUB having to do with low-lying things. Whether the primitive form is ¤Utubnu as in Etym (TUB) or ¤Utupnu as in MR:69, the stem-form would be *Utumnu-.
	utúvienyes, see *tuv-
	úva (1) vb. "will not", future tense of a negative verb (present/aorist tense úyë?) in Fíriel's Song. Compare #úva as the future tense of the negative verb ua- (q.v.) in a later source (PE17:144, where the verb is cited with a 1st person sg. ending: úvan). 
	úva- (2) vb. “impend, be imminent” – “nearly always in a bad sense: ‘threaten (to come)’ “, as in hrívë úva véna “winter is drawing near to us” (VT49:14)
	-uva future tense ending. In avuva, caluva, cenuva, hiruva, (en)quantuva, (en)tuluva, laituvalmet, lauva, maruvan, termaruva, tiruvantes. A final -a drops out before the ending -uva is added: quanta- “fill”, future tense quantuva (PE17:68). A verbal stem in -av- may be contracted when -uva follows, as when avuva is stated to have become auva (VT49:13). Origin/etymology of the ending -uva, see VT48:32. In VT49:30, the future tense of the verb “to be” is given as uva, apparently the future-tense “ending” appearing independently, but several other sources rather give nauva for “will be” (see ná #1).
	úvana adj. “unmarred” (PE17:150), rejected meaning: “monstrous” (PE17:149). The word for “unmarred” is alahasta (q.v.) in a more widely published source.
úvanë prep. + noun "without beauty", adj. úvanëa (VT39:14)
úvanima noun "not fair, ugly" (VT39:14). Negated form of vanima.
úvanimo noun "monster (creature of Melko[r]) (BAN, LT1:272); pl. úvanimor "monsters" is attested (UGU/UMU, (GŪ). According to VT45:7, 16 Tolkien did not capitalize the word úvanimo, though it was so printed in the entries BAN and GŪ in the Etymologies as printed in LR. The (pl.) form húvanimor was abandoned along with hú rather than ú- as a negative prefix, VT45:17.
	úvë noun "abundance, great quantity" (UB). Compare úmë #2.
	úvëa adj. "abundant, in very great number, very large" (UB). Compare úmëa.
	úvië noun "considering a matter (with a view to decision)" (VT48:32) Not to be confused with the plural form of úvëa.
	uxarë noun ”doing wrong” (PE17:151). Also uscarë. Cf. úcarë.
	úyë vb., a form occurring in Fíriel's Song (cf. VT46:22), apparently ye "is" with the negative prefix ú-, hence "is not" (úyë sérë indo-ninya símen, translated "my hearth resteth not here", literally evidently *"[there] is not rest [for] my heart here")

<V>
	va prep. "from" (VT43:20; prefixed in the form var- in var-úra "from evil", VT43:24). In VT49:24, va, au and o are quoted as variants of the stem awa “away from”.
	vá exclamation "I will not!" or "Do not!", interjection accompanied by a “jerk back of head” (PE17:145). It was inflected only in the 1st person sing. and 1st person pl. exclusive: ván, ványë "I won't!", vammë "we won't" (WJ:371, PE17:143; read *valmë in Second Edition Quenya, after Tolkien revised the pronominal suffixes in the sixties). 
	-va possessive ending, presumably related to the preposition va "from". In Eldaliéva, Ingoldova, miruvóreva, Oroméva,  rómeva, Valinóreva (q.v. for references), Follondiéva, Hyallondiéva (see under turmen for references). Following a consonant, the ending instead appears as -wa (andamacilwa “of the long sword”, PE17:147, rómenwa *”of the East”, PE17:59). Pl. -vë when governing a plural word (from archaic -vai) (WJ:407), but it seems that -va was used throughout in late Exilic Quenya (cf. miruvóreva governing the plural word yuldar in Namárië). Pl. -iva (-ivë), dual *-twa, partitive pl. -líva.
vacco ("k") noun "jacket, cloak" (GL:21, QL:100) 
	vaháya adj. "far away" (LR:47, SD:310). Also spelt vahaiya (SD:247)
	vahta- vb. "to soil, stain" (WA3)
	vaia < waia (also vaiya < waiya) noun "envelope", especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY). Cf. váya.
	vailë noun “wind” (PE17:189)
	vailima adj. “windy” (PE17:189)
	Vaiaro masc. name, a name of Ulmo, lord of Vaiya (WAY)
	vaima noun "wrap, robe" (QL:100, LT1:271)
	vaina (1) adj. "clad" (LT1:272)
vaina (2) adj., the “late” pronunciation of waina “blonde, fair of hair” (PE17:154)
	vainë noun "sheath" (LT1:271) 
	vainolë noun "quiver" (= case for holding arrows) (LT1:271)
	Vairë (1) fem. name "the Weaver", name of a Valië, spouse of Mandos (Silm, WEY). The name is translated "Ever-weaving" in VT39:10, and it is implied that the archaic form was *Wairē rather than ¤Weirē, the reconstruction given in the Etymologies (entry WEY). Tolkien considered changing the name to Vérë (PE17:33) One source glosses the literal meaning as “weaving” rather than “weaver” (PE17:191).
	vairë (2) adj. ?“wavy” (according to the editor, the gloss is almost illegible, but further notes may be taken as saying that the word describes wavy locks rather than wavy fluids). (PE17:34)
	vaiwë noun “wind” (PE17:189)
	vaita- vb. "to enfold" (VT46:21), "to wrap" (LT1:271). Older (MET) form waita-.
	vaiwa noun "wind" (WĀ/WAWA/WAIWA)
	vaiya < waiya (also vaia, waia) noun "envelope", especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY, capitalized Vaiya under GEY; the latter entry was struck out). In a "Qenya" text in MC:214, vaiya is simply translated "sky". In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, vaiya (/ waiya) was also the name of a tengwa letter that does not appear in Tolkien's later table, but which was apparently intended to have the value w > v, like the letter wilya > vilya in the later, canonical system (VT46:21). According to Arden R. Smith, the form of the pre-classical letter is a variant of #21, which letter Tolkien would later call vala (VT46:32).
	Vala (1) noun "Power, God, angelic power", pl. Valar or Vali (BAL, Appendix E, LT2:348), described as “angelic governors” or “angelic guardians” (Letters:354, 407). The Valar are a group of immensely powerful spirits guarding the world on behalf of its Creator; they are sometimes called Gods (as when Valacirca, q.v., is translated “Sickle of the Gods”), but this is strictly wrong according to Christian terminology: the Valar were created beings. The noun vala is also the name of tengwa #22 (Appendix E). Genitive plural Valion "of the Valar" (FS, MR:18); this form shows the pl. Vali, (irregular) alternative to Valar (the straightforward gen. pl. Valaron is also attested, PE17:175). Pl. allative valannar *"to/on the Valar" (LR:47, 56; SD:246). Feminine form Valië (Silm), in Tolkien’s earlier material also Valdë; his early writings also list Valon or Valmo (q.v.) as specifically masc. forms. The gender-specific forms are not obligatory; thus in PE17:22 Varda is called a Vala (not a Valië), likewise Yavanna in PE17:93. –  Vala is properly or originally a verb "has power" (sc. over the matter of Eä, the universe), also used as a noun "a Power" (WJ:403). The verb vala- "rule, order", exclusively used with reference to the Valar, is only attested in the sentences á vala Manwë! "may Manwë order it!" and Valar valuvar "the will of the Valar will be done" (WJ:404). However, Tolkien did not originally intend the word Valar to signify "powers"; in his early conception it apparently meant "the happy ones", cf. valto, vald- (LT2:348). – For various compounds including the word Vala(r), see below.
	vala- (2) vb. "to rule", only with reference to the Valar (see Vala). Future tense valuva is attested (WJ:404)
	Valacar masc. name, *"Vala-helmet"??? (Appendix A)
	Valacirca noun "Sickle of the Gods", a name of the Great Bear (Big Dipper) constellation (SA:val-, MR:388, KIRIK, OT/OTOS/OTOK)
	Valandil masc. name, "God-friend, *Vala-friend" (Appendix A, UT:210, translated in LR:60)
	Valandur masc. name, *"Vala-servant" (Appendix A)
	valaina adj. "of or belonging to the Valar, divine" (BAL)
	Valandor place-name "the land of the Valar", confused with and replaced by Valinórë "the people of the Valar", short form Valinor (SA:dôr, Silm)
	Valanya noun last day of the Eldarin six-day week, dedicated to the Valar (Appendix D). Etymology, see Letters:427. Also called Tárion.
	Valaquenta noun "Account of the Valar" (SA:val-). See quenta.
	Valarauco ("k") noun "Demon of Might" (here vala- assumes its basic meaning "power, might"), Sindarin balrog (WJ:415). Pl. Valaraucar (sic, not -or) "Balrogs", apparently containing rauca (q.v.) as an alternative form of rauco “demon” (SA:val-, SA:rauco). Earlier forms from the "Qenya Lexicon" are Valcaraucë, Malcaraucë (q.v.), apparently abandoned in LotR-style Quenya.
	#Valariandë place-name "Beleriand" (genitive in the phrase Nyarna Valarianden "the annals of Beleriand" in LR:202; Tolkien later changed the genitive ending from -n to -o; hence read *Nyarna Valariandëo) In the essay Quendi and Eldar, Heceldamar turns up as another Quenya term for Beleriand.
	Valarin adj. “Valian”, of or relating to the Valar, as noun = Lambë Valarinwa "Valarin tongue" (WJ:397). It may be that Valarinwa is the normal form of the adjective “Valian” in Quenya.
	Valarindi pl. noun "offspring of the Valar, their children begotten in Arda" (sg. #Valarindë). (MR:49). Compare indi.
	Valaróma noun "Vala-horn", Oromë's horn (Silm, MR:7)
	valassë noun "divinity" (or rather *"valahood"; the word should probably not be used with reference to the divinity of Eru). (BAL)
	Valatar (Valatár- as in "gen.sg. Valatáren", in Tolkien's later Quenya this is a dative singular instead) noun "Vala-king", applied to the nine chief (male) Valar: Manwe, Ulmo, Aule, Mandos, Lorien, Tulkas, Ossë, Orome, and Melko[r]. Note: This list, set down in the Etymologies, differs from the scenario of the published Silmarillion; Ossë is not a Vala in Tolkien's later conception. (BAL, VT46:17). Compare Valatári.
	Valatári noun "Vala-queen" (BAL; this entry of the Etymologies states that Vala has no feminine form except this compound, but Silm gives Valië as a feminine form). The word Valatári is apparently also the unchanged plural form, so used in this quote: "The Valatári were Varda, Yavanna, Nienna, Vana, Vaire, Este, Nessa, Uinen" (BAL; Tolkien later reclassified Uinen as a Maia, not a Valatári/Valië). Notice that the plural form of Valatar would apparently also be *Valatári.
	valcanë ("k") adj. "vague" (MC:213; this is "Qenya")
	Valcaraucë ("k") noun "balrog", also Malcaraucë (LT1:250; in Tolkien's later Quenya valarauco)
	vald- noun "blessedness, happiness" (LT1:272 – a final vowel would seem to be required). See valin regarding the dubious conceptual validity of this and related words.
valda adj. "worth, worthy, dear" (GL:23)
	Valdë noun "female Vala" (also Valis) (LT1:272, in Tolkien's later Quenya Valië, Valatári)
	valdëa adj. “of moment, important” (QL:102)
	Valië noun female Vala; pl. Valier attested (Silm)
	valima adj. "happy" (QL:99). See valin.
	Valimar place-name "Vali-home" (Vali = Valar), the city of the Valar in Valinor, also in shorter form Valmar. Cf. the Silmarillion: “the city of Valimar where all is glad” (Valaquenta); “in the midst of the plain beyond the mountains they [the Valar] built their city, Valmar of many bells” (chapter 1). In Namárië, the word Valimar is used = Valinor, since Valimar was its chief city (Nam, RGEO:67)
	valin adj. "happy" (LT1:272, ). This word, as well as valima and vald-, connect with Tolkien's early concept of Valar meaning "happy ones".  Since the term Valar was later reinterpreted as "the Powers", the conceptual validity of these terms for "happy” depends on whether the bliss associated with the Valar and Valinor is regarded as sufficient to give them a secondary justification.
	Valinor place-name "the land (or people) of the Valar", *"Vali-land" (Vali = Valar), land of the Gods in the West (BAL, NDOR); cf. Valandor. Full form Valinórë (BAL; Vali-nórë under NDOR). Said to be “the true Eldarin name of Aman”, the latter name being explained as a borrowing from Valarin in some versions of the linguistic scenario (VT49:26). In the early "Qenya Lexicon", Valinor, Valinórë is glossed "Asgard", the name of the city of the gods in Norse mythology (LT1:272). It seems that in such more restricted use, Valinor is not the entire Blessed Realm but rather the specific region beyond the Pelóri where (most of) the Valar dwelt, with Val(i)mar as the chief city. Thus it is said of Eärendil that he “went into Valinor and to the halls of Valimar” only after he had already left his ship and ventured as far as Tirion (Silmarillion, chapter 24). – Possessive Valinóreva in Nurtalë Valinóreva, the "Hiding of Valinor", the possessive case here assuming the function of object genitive (Silm); genitive Valinórëo in Yénië Valinórëo “Annals of Valinor” (MR:200; the last word was changed from Valinóren, Tolkien revising the genitive ending from -n to -o)
	Valis noun "female Vala" (also Valdë) (LT1:272; in Tolkien's later Quenya Valië)
	Valmar alternative form of Valimar, q.v. (Silm)
	Valmo noun "male Vala" (also Valon) (LT1:272; these forms may or may not be valid in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Valon noun "male Vala" (also Valmo) (LT1:272; these forms may or may not be valid in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Valsi = Valis? (LT1:272)
	*valta-, later pronunciation of walta-, q.v.
-valta suffix "-less", also -viltë (evidently endings used to derive adjectives like "lifeless") (GL:23) The ending -lóra appears with the same meaning in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	valto noun "luck" (LT1:272)
	valya adj. "having (divine) authority or power" (BAL; this word is of course etymologically connected to the Valar and should not be used with reference to the divinity of Eru.)
	ván noun "goose"; pl. váni given (WA-N). Older wán.
	Vána fem. name, a Valië, the wife of Oromë (Silm, WJ:383); the Etymologies gives Vana with no long vowel (BAN). The apparent meaning is *“beautiful (one)”, since she was “the most perfectly ‘beautiful’ in form and feature…representing the natural unmarred perfection of form in living things” (PE17:150).
	Vanar or Vani pl. noun, = Valar (LT1:272)
	vand- noun "way, path" (LT1:264; a final vowel would seem to be required, but in Tolkien's later Quenya, the words tië or mallë are to be preferred)
	vanda (1) noun "oath, pledge, solemn promise" (CO)
	[vanda] (2) noun "prison, Hell" (cf. Angavanda). (VT45:6; this word was apparently rejected in favour of mando)
	vandl noun "staff" (LT1:264) (No word can end in -dl in Tolkien's later Quenya; the word may be adapted as *vandil. Compare findl, findil.)
	vanë adj. "fair" (LT1:272; in Tolkien's later Quenya rather vanya)
	vánë past tense of auta-, q.v. (WJ:366)
	vanessë noun "beauty" (LT1:272, PE17:56). Also vanië.
vanga noun "beard" (LT2:344, GL:21; in Tolkien's later Quenya fanga)
	vangwë noun “blow” (PE17:34), i.e. a blast of wind
vanië noun “beauty” (PE17:56), apparently formed from vanya #1. Synonym vanessë. 
	vánië vb., an augmentless perfect of auta- (q.v.) that may occur in verse; regular form avánië (WJ:366)
vanima adj. "beautiful, fair" (BAN, VT39:14) (glossed "proper, right, fair" in early "Qenya", LT1:272, though a later source says the word is used “only of living things, especially Elves and Men”, PE17:150); nominal pl. vanimar "beautiful ones", partitive pl. genitive vanimálion, translated "of beautiful children", but literally meaning *"of [some] beautiful ones") (LotR3:VI ch. 6, translated in Letters:308). Arwen vanimalda "Beautiful Arwen", literally "Arwen your beauty" (see -lda for reference; changed to Arwen vanimelda in the second edition of LotR; see vanimelda). 
	vanimalda adj. with suffix *"your beautiful"; Arwen vanimalda "Arwen your beauty = beautiful Arwen" (WJ:369, cf. PE17:55). The ending for sg. "your" normally appears as -lya rather than -lda (which according to late sources is rather the ending for plural “your”, here inappropriate). Originally Tolkien seems to have intended vanimalda as an inflected form of vanima “beautiful”, the ending -lda expressing comparative, superlative or simply “exceedingly” (PE17:56: vanimalda = “exceeding fair”). However, since this ending was later revised out of existence, Tolkien reinterpreted the word. The Second Edition of LotR changes one letter to arrive at the reading vanimelda, q.v. for Tolkien’s new explanation.%
	vanimelda adj., said to be “the highest word of praise for beauty”, with two interpretations that were apparently considered equally valid and simultaneously true: “beautiful and beloved” (vanima + melda, with haplology), i.e. “movingly lovely”, but also “elven-fair” (fair as an Elf) (vanima + elda). The word was also used as the second name of Arwen. (PE17:56, Second Edition LotR1:II ch. 16). 
	Vanimeldë fem. name (Appendix A), apparently a feminized form of the adj. vanimelda, q.v.
	Vanimo (pl. Vanimor given), noun "the beautiful", children of the Valar (BAN), or "fair folk" = (men and) elves (UGU/UMU, VT45:17). Negated úvanimor = "monsters".
	vannë pa.t. of vanya- (WAN)
	vanta- (1) vb. "to walk" (BAT)
vanta (2) noun "walk" (BAT)
	vanwa adj. "gone, lost, no longer to be had, vanished, departed, dead, past, past and over, gone on the road, over" (WJ:366, Nam, RGEO:67, WAN, LT1:264; older wanwa, PE17:143). The word was “not applied to dead persons except those who would not return, either because of a special doom (as [in the case of] Men) or because of a special will of their own (as Felagund or Míriel) or a special ban of Mandos (as Feanor)” (PE17:143). Also see avanwa. 
	vanwië noun "the past, past time" (WAN)
	vanya (1) adj. "fair" (FS), "beautiful" (BAN), a word referring to beauty that is “due to lack of fault, or blemish” (PE17:150), hence Arda Vanya as an alternative to Arda Alahasta for “Arda Unmarred” (ibid., compare MR:254). Nominal pl. Vanyar "the Fair", the first clan of the Eldar; the original meaning of this stem was "pale, light-coloured, not brown or dark" (WJ:382, 383, stem given as WAN), “properly = white complexion and blonde hair” (PE17:154, stem given as GWAN); stems BAN vs. WAN discussed, see PE17:150.
	vanya- (2) vb. "go, depart, disappear", pa.t. vannë (WAN). The verb auta- may have replaced this word in Tolkien's later conception.
	váquet- vb. (1st pers. aorist váquetin and 1st pers. past tense váquenten are given) "to say no" (not denying that something is true, but denying to do or to allow something: "to say I will not/do not"; "to refuse", "to forbid" (WJ:370, 371)
	var (1) conj. "or" (QL:100). In Tolkien’s later Quenya, the word hya appears for “or”. A phrase involving a double var…var may mean “either…or” in one early (untranslated) text, according to Christopher Gilson’s interpretation (PE15:32, 39)
	var- (2), see va
	vára adj. "soiled, dirty" (WA3)
	varanda adj. “sublime” (PE17:23), related to the name Varda. 
	vard- vb. "rule, govern" (LT1:273; hardly valid in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	Varda fem. name "the Sublime", name of a Valië, spouse of Manwë, the Queen of the Valar, called Elbereth in Sindarin (BARATH, BARÁD, WJ:402; in Letters:282 Varda is translated the "Lofty"). As a general adjective “sublime”, †varda could still occur as a poetic word in verse (PE17:23), but normal prose would apparently rather use the related word varanda (q.v.) Genitive Vardo (for *Vardao). (Nam, RGEO:66). Vardamir masc. name, *"Varda-jewel" (Appendix A, UT:210); vardarianna ?"Varda-gift", name of a tree (but the ri element is obscure) (UT:167)
	vardar noun "king" (LT1:273; rather aran in LotR-style Quenya)
	Vardilmë, fem. name (UT:210), perhaps *"Varda-friend; one devoted to Varda" (if so this would be a contraction of *Vardandilmë, with -(n)dilmë as the feminine form of -ndil "friend")
	Vardo Meoita noun "Prince of Cats" (LT2:348; vardo "prince" is hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya; cf. vard-, vardar. Later Quenya has cundu for "prince".)
	varna adj. "safe, protected, secure" (BAR)
	varnassë noun "security" (BAR)
	varnë (1) adj. "brown, swart, dark brown", stem-form varni- (BARÁN)
	[varnë] (2) noun "protection" (BAR) 
	varni noun "queen" (LT1:273; rather tári in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	[varilë] noun "protection" (VT45:7)
	varya- vb. "to protect" (BAR)
	Vása noun "the Consumer", a name of the Sun (MR:130, Silm)
vasar (þ) noun "veil" (VT42:10, the word was "not in daily use", VT42:9). Older form waþar. 
vasarya- (þ) vb. "to veil" (VT42:10)
	váva vb.? “blow” (the wording used in the source is unclear, but wā-ya is said to mean “blow”, and after discussing Sindarin forms Tolkien instructs himself to “alter Quenya”, introducing a new primitive form ¤wā-wā with váva- as the Quenya outcome. Possibly this still means “blow” as a verb referring to wind.) –PE17:34  
	vávëa adj. “(con)similar, alike”, also ovéa (PE17:189)
	vaxë noun “strain” (WA3)
váya noun ”sea” (considered as ”waters, motion”). The wording of the source indicates that Tolkien only tentatively considered such a word (PE17:33)
	ve (1) prep. "as, like" (Nam, RGEO:66, Markirya, MC:213, 214, VT27:20, 27, VT49:22); in Narqelion ve may mean either "in" or "as". Ve fírimor quetir *”as mortals say” (VT49:10), ve senwa (or senya) “as usual” (VT49:10). Followed by genitive, ve apparently expresses “after the manner of”: ve quenderinwë coaron (“k”) “after the manner of bodies of Elven-kind” (PE17:174). Tolkien variously derived Quenya ve from older wē, bē or vai (VT49:10, 32, PE17:189)
	ve (2) pron. “we”, 1st person pl. inclusive (corresponding to exclusive me), derived from an original stem-form we (VT49:50, PE17:130). Variant vi, q.v. Stressed wé, later vé (VT49:51). Dative (*wéna >) véna, VT49:14. Dual wet, later *vet “the two of us” (inclusive; cf. exclusive met) (VT49:51). Also compare the dative form ngwin or ngwen (q.v.), but this would apparently be *wen > *ven according to Tolkien’s later ideas.
	-vë, (3) apparently an ending used to derive adverbs from adjectives (see andavë under anda and oiavë under oia). May be related to the preposition ve “as, like”.
vëa (1) adj. “seeming, apparent” (PE17:189)
	vëa (2) adj. "adult, manly, vigorous" (WEG)
	vëa (3) noun "sea" (MC:213, 214, 216; possibly obsoleted by #1 and #2 above, though some argue that the initial element of the late names Vëantur and Vëandur [q.v.] could be vëa #3 rather than #2 (it can hardly be #1) . In any case, the normal word for "sea" in LotR-style Quenya seems to be ëar.) Inflected vëan "sea" (MC:220), vëar "in sea" (a "Qenya" locative in -r, MC:213), vëassë "on sea" (MC:220). Cf. also vëaciryo.
vëa (4) noun “wind” (PE17:189)
	vëaciryo ("k") noun in genitive "of sea-ship", genitive of *vëacirya ("k") (MC:216; this is "Qenya"; see vëa # 2)
	Vëandur, masc. name (PM:191), either *"Vigorous servant" or *"Sea-servant" (= mariner; compare ëarendur, etymologically very similar if the Qenya form vëa "sea" was maintained in later Quenya). See vëa #1 and 2 and compare Vëantur.
	vëaner noun "(adult) man" (WEG)
	Vëantur, masc. name (UT:171), either *"Vigorous lord" or *"Sea-lord" (see vëa #1 and 2; those who prefer the translation *"Sea-lord" see this name as evidence that Tolkien maintained the Qenya noun vëa "sea" in later Quenya). Compare Vëandur.
	vëassë noun "vigour" (WEG)
	[vecca adj. “active”, ancient form (PE17:190)]
vehtë noun “’life’ - not Life in general or as a principle, but (a period of) individual activity”, thus also “the place where a person, people &c. lived and had their business, i.e. habitat, haunt” (PE17:189)
vehtequentalë noun ”biography” (PE17:189)
	#vel- see véla #2
	véla (1) adv. *“alike” (VT49:10)
	véla (2) vb. "see" (Arct); present/continuative tense of a verbal stem #vel-? The context of the sentence where it occurs ("till I see you next") suggests that this is "see" in the sense of "meet".
	velca ("k") noun "flame" (LT1:260; nár, nárë would be the normal word in Tolkien's later Quenya)
	velicë ("k") adj. "great" (LT1:254; probably not valid in Tolkien's later Quenya; in the context of the Etymologies it would have to be derived from BEL, but it is stated that this stem was "not found in Q". Perhaps Tolkien rejected velicë because it was too similar to the Russian word that clearly inspired it.)
	v'emattë ??? May be the preposition ve + an otherwise unknown word emattë. (Narqelion)
	vembë, see 'wembë
	véna pron. “for us”, (long) dative form of ve # 2, q.v.
	vendë < wendë noun "maiden" (WEN/WENED, VT45:16), "virgin" (in Tolkien's translations of Catholic prayers where the reference is to Mary; see VT44:10, 18). The form Véndë in VT44:10 seems abnormal; normally Quenya does not have a long vowel in front of a consonant cluster.
	venë noun "small boat, vessel, dish" (LT1:254)
	vénë < wénë noun "virginity" (WEN/WENED); in one source vénë also appears with the concrete meaning "virgin" (VT44:10), but this is normally vendë, wendë instead.
	*vénëa adj. *"maidenly, virginal" (VT44:10; the source has véne' alcarë *"virginal glory", the first word possibly representing an adjective *vénëa the final vowel of which has been elided since the next word begins in the same vowel.)
	venessë noun "virginity" (WEN/WENED)
	venië noun? "shape, cut" (LT1:254)
	venno noun "husband" (cited as **verno in the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry BES, but according to VT45:7, this is a misreading of Tolkien's manuscript). In a later source, the word for “husband” is given as veru, q.v.
	venta noun "chin" (QL:101)
	venwë noun? "shape, cut" (LT1:254)
	†vëo noun "man" (WEG; etymologically connected to vëa "manly, vigorous"; the more neutral word for "man" is nér. According to VT46:21, Tolkien indicated that vëo is an archaic or poetic word.) Tolkien at a later point defined the word as “living creature” (PE17:189). Cf. variant wëo, q.v.
	véra (< Old Quenya wéra) noun "personal, private, own" (PM:340)
	verca ("k") adj. "wild" (BERÉK)
	vérë (1) noun "bond, troth, compact, oath" (WED)
	Vérë (2) fem. name, tentative replacement form for the name Vairë, apparently never introduced in any narratives (PE17:33)
	veri noun “wife” (VT49:45)
	verië noun "boldness" (BER)
	**verno noun "husband", misreading for venno, q.v. (BES)
	verta- vb. “to give in marriage” (give a person in marriage to another); also “to take as husband or wife (to oneself)” (VT49:45)
	veru (1) noun “husband” (VT49:45). An earlier source gives the word for “husband” as venno.
veru (2) dual noun "husband and wife, married pair" (BES). Obsoleted by #1 above? (Notice that the word veru “married pair” comes from the same source that has venno rather than veru as the word for “husband”.)
	verya- (1) vb. "to dare"; also adj. verya "bold" (BER, VT45:7)
	verya (2) vb. “to marry (of husband and wife), be joined to” (intransitive; the spouse to be is mentioned in the allative case: veryanen senna *”I married him/her”; compare English “get married to someone”). (VT49:45, 46)
	veryanwë “wedding”; veryanwesto “of your (dual) wedding” (VT49:44, 45)
	vessë noun "wife" (BES). A later source gives the word for “wife” as veri.
	vesta noun "matrimony" (BES, VT49:46)
vesta- vb. "to wed" (BES, VT49:46). (Under WED, the verb vesta- was defined as "swear to do something", but this was struck out.)
	vestalë noun "wedding" (BES, VT49:46) (under WED the word was defined as "oath", but this was struck out)
	*vet, see ve #2
	vi pron. ”we”, 1st person inclusive (PE17:130), variant of ve #2.
	vië noun "manhood, vigour" (WEG)
	vil- vb. "to fly" (The forms given are the 1st pers. aorist vilin "I fly" and the pa.t. villë. Tolkien replaced wilin with wil-, pa.t. presumably *wille, but this may not render vil- obsolete; rather, Tolkien simply decided to cite the verb in its Old Quenya form, before the merger of w- with v- that occurred in Exilic Quenya.) (WIL)
	[vilda], see vilwa
	vílë noun "gentle breeze" (LT1:273)
	vilin adj. "airy, breezy" (LT1:273). Not to be confused with vilin "I fly", see vil-.
vilissë noun "spirit" (GL:23)
-viltë adjectival ending "-less", also -valta (evidently endings used to derive adjectives like "lifeless") (GL:23). Rather -lóra in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	[vilwa < wilwa] noun "air, lower air" (distinct from the 'upper' air of the stars, or the 'outer') (WIL; in one place vilwa was not struck out, VT46:21) According to VT46:21, Tolkien considered vilda < wilda as a replacement form, but rejected it.
	vilya noun "air, sky", also name of tengwa #24. Older wilya. (Appendix E). Early "Qenya" has Vilya (changed from Vilna) "lower air" (LT1:273); also vilya "air" (MC:215)

	Vincarna compounded passive participle *"new-made, renewed" (MR:408)

	*vinta- (1) vb, later pronunctiation of winta- “scatter”, q.v.
	[vinta- (2) vb. "fade", pa.t. vintë, vintanë given. (WIN/WIND) Compare vinda-.]
	vinya (1) adj. "young" (VT46:22, VT47:26, PE17:191) or "new" (cf. compounds Vinyamar, Vinyarië below; cf. also winya "new, fresh, young" in a deleted entry in the Etymologies, VT45:16; there the word was first written as vinya.) Vinya “the Young”, original name of the isle of Númenor among its own people (SD:332).
	vinya (2) < windya adj. "pale blue" (WIN/WIND) (It is uncertain whether Tolkien rejected this word or not; in any case, vinya is only attested with the meaning "young, new" in his later Quenya.)
	Vinyamar place-name *"New Dwelling" (Silm)
	*vinyamo, see winyamo
	Vinyarië noun "Newyear's Day" (PM:127)
	[vinyë noun "evening" (VT46:21)]
	Víressë noun, fourth month of the year, "April" (Appendix D). The Quenya name is apparently related to words for youth and freshness; compare vírië, virya.
	vírië noun "youth" (as abstract) (VT46:22)
	vírin noun "a magic glassy substance of great lucency used in fashioning the Moon. Used of things of great and pure transparency." (LT2:339)

	vista- (2) vb. "change" (transitive), pa.t. vistanë, cf. intransitive virya-, q.v. (PE17:189, 191)
	vó (actually spelt vô), also vondo, noun "son" (LT2:336; in Tolkien's later Quenya yondo)
	vor, voro adv. "ever" (BOR, LT1:250, 273 [only voro in the Etymologies]; also in Narqelion)
	vora, vorë adv. "always"; see voro
	vórë noun? "lasting" (as noun? i.e. *"lasting quality"?) Compare the derived adj. vórea. (VT45:7)
	vórëa adj. "continuous, enduring, lasting" (VT45:7)
	vorima adj. "continual, repeated" (BOR), early "Qenya" gloss "everlasting" (LT1:250)
	vórima (more or less identical to vorima above?) adj. "steadfast in allegiance, in keeping oath or promise, faithful"; genitive vórimo in a variant of CO; see UT:317. In VT45:7, vórima is glossed "continuous, enduring, repeated".
	voro, voro- adv. "ever, continually" (BOR, Narqelion) Compare vor. (Focusing on the gloss "continually", post-Tolkien writers have sometimes used voro for "still, yet", but for this sense the term en is available.) The variants vora, vorë were used for "always" in drafts for a Quenya version of the Sub Tuum Praesidium, but Tolkien eventually replaced such forms with the unrelated word illumë (VT44:9). Compare vórë, vórëa.
	vorongandelë noun "harping on one tune", continual repetition. In the Etymologies as printed in LR, this word is misprinted as "vorogandale"; see VT45:7. (BOR)
	voronda adj. "steadfast in allegiance, in keeping oath or promise, faithful", used as a title of Elendil Voronda "Elendil the Faithful"; genitive Vorondo in CO. Only glossed "faithful" in LT1:250.
	Vorondil masc.name, *"Faithful friend" (Appendix A)
	voronwa adj. "enduring, long-lasting" (BOR)
	voronwë noun "steadfastness, loyalty, faithfulness" (CO), also as masc. name Voronwë "the Faithful" (PM:340, BORÓN, LT1:250)
	voronwië noun "endurance, lasting quality" (BOR)
	vorosanya (þ) adj. "regular, law-abiding, normal" (VT46:16); also just sanya (þ). The prefix voro- means “ever” or “continually”.

<W>

Note: In Exilic Quenya, initial w- turned into v-, as Tolkien indicated in a number of the words here recorded.

	-wa, variant of the possessive ending -va (as in andamacilwa, PE17:147), used following a consonant.
	wá (actually spelt wâ) noun "wind" (LT1:266). Cf. wáya-.
	wai (what the primitive element ¤wei "wind, weave" became in Quenya; therefore confused with the stem WAY "enfold") (WEY)
	waia > vaia noun "envelope", especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY) (also vaiya, waiya)
	wailë noun “wind”, later form vailë, q.v. (PE17:189)
	waina adj. “blonde, fair of hair”; the “late” form vaina is given (PE17:154)
	waita- > vaita- verb "to enfold" (VT46:21)
	waiwa noun "wind" (WĀ/WAWA/WAIWA)
	waiya > vaiya (also vaia, waia) noun "envelope", especially of the Outer Sea or Air enfolding the world within the Ilurambar or world-walls (WAY)
	walda adj. “excited, wild” (PE17:154)
	walmë noun “excitement, emotion” (PE17:154, 189)
	walta- vb. “to excite, rouse, stir up” (PE17:154)
	walwistë noun “change of mind” (PE17:189)
	walya- vb. “be excited (moved)” (PE17:154)  
	wán > ván noun "goose" (WA-N).
	wanwa (1) adj. older form of vanwa “lost, gone” etc. (see vanwa) (PE17:143)
	wanwa (2) noun "great gale" (LT1:266). This word would clash with vanwa “gone, lost” after the change of initial w > v, and since the latter is also said to come from older wanwa (PE17:143), this “Qenya” term for “great gale” is probably conceptually obsolete.
	wanwavoitë noun "windy" (LT1:266). Compare wanwa above.
	waþar older form of vasar, q.v. (VT42:9)
	wáya- “blow” (PE17:34, cf. wanwa), perhaps altered to váva (q.v.; the wording of the source is unclear)
	we, wé, see ve #2
	-wë a suffix occurring in many personal names, generally but not exclusively masculine (Elenwë is the sole certain example of a fem. name with this ending); it is derived from a stem simply meaning "person" (PM:340, WJ:399). In Etym, -wë is simply defined as an element that is frequent in masculine names, and it is there derived from a stem (WEG) having to do with "(manly) vigour".
	'wembë noun “worm” (QL:103). Read *vembë if the word is to be adopted to Third Age Quenya according to Tolkien's later ideas.
	wén noun "greenness, youth, freshness" (GWEN), blended with wendë "maid"
	wen noun "maid, girl" (*wend-), in early "Qenya" also wendi (Tolkien's later Quenya form wendë occurs in MC:215 and in Etym, stems GWEN, WEN/WENED). (LT1:271, 273) 
	-wen "maiden" as suffix, a frequent ending in feminine names like Eärwen *"Sea-maiden" (SA:wen). Early "Qenya" also has -wen, feminine patronymic *"daughter of" (LT1:271, 273), but the patronymic ending seems to be -iel "-daughter" in Tolkien's later Quenya.
	wenci ("k") noun, apparently a diminutive form of the stem wēn- "woman, maiden". It is possible that this is meant to be Common Eldarin rather than Quenya; if so the Quenya form would be *wencë (compare nercë "little man") (VT48:18)
	wendë noun "maid" (GWEN), wendë > vendë "maiden" (WEN/WENED, VT45:16, VT47:17). Sana wendë “that maiden” (PE16:96 cf. 90). According to VT47:17, this word for "maiden" is "applied to all stages up to the fully adult (until marriage)". Early "Qenya" also had wendi "maid, girl" (LT1:271); this may look like a plural form in Tolkien’s later Quenya. On the other hand, VT48:18 lists a word wendi "young or small woman, girl". It is unclear whether this is Quenya or a Common Eldarin form, but probably the former: PE17:191 displays the word for “maiden” as wendē, so the Quenya stem form is probably *wende- rather than wendi-, the stem-form that would result from Common Eldarin *wendi). In his Quenya translation of the Sub Tuum Praesidium, Tolkien used Wendë/Vendë to translate "virgin" with reference to the Virgin Mary. Here the plural genitive Wenderon appears in the phrase Wendë mi Wenderon "Virgin of Virgins"; we might have expected *Wendion instead (VT44:18). If the pl. form of wendë is *wender rather than wendi, as the gen.pl. wenderon suggests, this may be to avoid confusion with the sg. wendi “girl”.
	wendelë noun "maidenhood" (LT1:271, PE17:191)
	wendi noun “maid, girl” (LT1:271), “young or small woman, girl” (VT48:18); see wendë
	wénë > vénë noun "virginity" (WEN/WENED)
wentë noun "brook" (GL:46)
	wenya adj. "green, yellow-green, fresh" (GWEN), apparently “fair, beautiful” (“probably originally “fresh, fair, unblemished especially of beauty of youth”) in a later deleted note (PE17:191).
wëo noun “living creature”, variant of vëo, q.v. (PE17:189)
	wéra, Old Quenya form of véra, q.v.
	were- vb. “weave” (cited as a derivative of the root WER “twine, weave” and maybe a primitive form rather than a Quenya word). (PE17:33)
	wet, see we #2
	wil- vb. "fly" (1st pers. aorist wilin "I fly"; changed from vilin pa.t. villë, which would be the forms used in later Exilic Quenya. The older pa.t. would be willë.) (WIL). The early "Qenya" lexicon has wili- "sail, float, fly" (LT1:273)
	[wilda], see wilwa
	wilin noun "bird" (LT1:273; if this "Qenya" word is to be used in LotR-style Quenya, it must not be confused with the 1st pers. aorist of the verb wil-.)
	wilma noun "air, lower air" (distinct from the 'upper' air of the stars, or the 'outer') (WIL) 
	wilwa adj. "vague, fluttering to and fro" (Markirya). A similar word in the Etymologies was struck out: [wilwa > vilwa] "air, lower air" (distinct from the 'upper' air of the stars, or the 'outer') (WIL) According to VT46:21, Tolkien considered wilda > vilda as a replacement form, but rejected it.
	wilwarin (wilwarind-, as in pl. wilwarindi) noun "butterfly" (Markirya, WIL, LT1:273); Wilwarin name of a constellation, tentatively identified as Cassiopeia (Silm). "Qenya" adjective wilwarindeën "like butterflies" (MC:216); see wilwarindëa for Quenya form. "Qenya" similative form wilwarindon "as a butterfly" (MC:213, 220); Tolkien later abandoned the ending -ndon (PE17:58)
wilwarindëa adj. “like a wilwarin or butterfly”, pl. wilwarindië (PE16:96)
	wilya see vilya
	winca noun “corner, nook” (QL:104, there written ‘winka). Read *vinca if this early “Qenya” form is to be adapted to LotR-style Third Age Quenya.
	wincë, short form of winicë, q.v.
	winda noun "woof" (LT1:254)
	[windë > vindë adj. "pale blue" (VT45:16)]
	windelë noun "loom" (LT1:254)
	windya > vinya adj. "pale blue" (WIN/WIND) (It is uncertain whether Tolkien rejected this word or not; in any case, vinya means "new" in his later versions of Quenya.)
	winë (stem *wini-, given the primitive form ¤wini) noun "baby, child not yet fully grown", "little-one", also used in children's play for "little finger" or "little toe" (VT46:10, 26, VT48:6, 16). Synonyms win(i)cë, winimo. In Exilic Quenya, this word would appear as *vinë; compare the related word winya > vinya "young, new".
	winga noun "foam, spray" (Markirya). Also wingë.
	wingë noun "foam, crest of wave, crest" (WIG); "foam, spindrift" (LT1:273). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, wingë was also the name of tengwa #24, which letter Tolkien would later call wilya > vilya instead. - Also winga (so in Markirya).
	Wingelot, Wingelótë ship-name, "foam-flower", name of Earendel's [sic] boat (WIG, LOT(H) )
	wingil (wingild-, as in pl. Wingildi) noun "nymph" (WIG, LT1:273, PE16:19); "Qenya" pl. wingildin "foam-fays, foam-maidens" (MC:216)
	wingilot noun "foamflower, Eärendel's boat" (LT1:273; in Tolkien's later Quenya Wingelot, Wingelóte)
	winicë (also wincë), noun "baby", also used in children's play for "little finger" or "little toe" (VT48:6). Synonyms winë, winimo. In Exilic Quenya, this word would appear as *vinicë, *vincë; compare the related word winya > vinya "young, new". Since the diminutive ending -icë descends from -iki (VT48:16), winicë may have the stem-form winici-.
	winima adj. "childish" (VT47:26). In Exilic Quenya, this word would appear as *vinima; compare the related word winya > vinya "young, new".
	winimo noun "baby", "little-one", used in children's play for "little finger" or "little toe" (VT47:10, VT48:6, 16). Synonyms winë, win(i)cë. In Exilic Quenya, this word would appear as *vinimo; compare the related word winya > vinya "young, new".
	winta- vb. "scatter, blow about" (both transitive and intransitive) (PM:376)
wintil noun "glint" (LT1:261)
	winya (1) adj. "new, fresh, young" (VT45:16; though the entry including this form was struck out in the Etymologies, vinya "new" is a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya, and it is meant to represent older winya. Compare winyamo, q.v.)
	[winya (2), see vinya #2 (WIN/WIND)]
	winyamo noun "youngster" (VT47:26). In Exilic Quenya, this word would appear as *vinyamo; compare the related word winya > vinya "young, new".
	Wirilómë fem. name; a name of the great Spider (Ungoliant) (LT1:254)
	wirnë noun? “change” (PE17:191)
	wistë noun "weft" (LT1:254)

<X>
	-xë (“ks”) reflextive pronominal ending, presumably meaning *“oneself, myself, themselves” etc.; plural -xer, dual -xet (VT49:48). Presumably it can be used in constructions like *i nér tirnexë “the man watched himself” (*tirnesexë “he watched himself”), plural *i neri tirnexer “the men watched themselves” (*tirneltexer “they watched themselves”), dual e.g. *i ontaru tirnexet “the parents watched themselves” (*tirnettexet “they [dual] watched themselves”).

<Y>
	yá (1) adv.? "formerly", also postposition (?) "ago" (YA). The form yá also appears as a variant of the relative pronoun ya, q.v.
	yá (2) conj. “when” in the sentence yá hrívë tenë, ringa ná “when winter comes, it is cold” (VT49:23). Compare írë #2.
	ya (1) relative pronoun "which, what" (attested in VT43:28, 34 and in the Arctic sentence), with locative suffix in Namárië: see #yassë. According to VT47:21, ya is impersonal, "which" rather than "who(m)" (compare the personal form ye). The dative form yan (q.v.) is however used for "to whom" (rather than “to which”) in one text, indicating that Tolkien did not always distinguish between personal and impersonal forms. In the phrase lúmessë ya [variant: yá] firuvammë, *"in [the] hour that we shall die", the relative pronoun is not explicitly marked for case and is evidently understood to share the case of the preceding noun (hence not *lúmessë yassë... "in [the] hour in which"...) (VT43:27-28) Presumably, ya has the plural form *yar (e.g. *i nati yar hirnen “the things that/which I found”). 
	ya (2) or yan, prep. "as" (VT43:16, probably abandoned in favour of sívë)
	-ya (3) suffix of endearment, attested in Anardilya as an intimate form of the name Anardil (UT:174, 418), possibly also occurring in atya "dad", emya "mum" (q.v.) The forms ataryo "daddy" and amilyë "mummy" (q.v.) may contain gender-specific variants -yo masc. and -yë fem. 
	-ya (4) pronominal suffix “his” (and probably also “her, its”), said to be used in “colloquial Quenya” (which had redefined the “correct” ending for this meaning, -rya, to mean “their” because it was associated with the plural ending -r). Hence e.g. cambeya (“k”) “his hand”, yulmaya “his cup” (VT49:17) instead of formally “correct” forms in -rya. The ending -ya was actually ancient, primitive ¤-jā being used for “all numbers” in the 3rd person, predating elaborated forms like -rya. It is said that -ya “remained in Quenya” in the case of “old nouns with consonantal stems”, Tolkien listing tál “foot”, cas “head”, nér “man”, sír “river” and macil “sword” as examples. He refers to “the continued existence of such forms as talya ‘his foot’“, that could apparently be used even in “correct” Quenya (VT49:17). In PE17:130, the forms talya “his foot” and macilya (“k”) “his (or their) sword” are mentioned.
	-ya (5) adjectival ending, as in the word Quenya “Elvish” itself; when added to a verbal stem it may derive a kind of short active participle, as in melumatya “honey-eating” (mat- “eat”), saucarya “evil-doing” (car- “do”). (PE17:68)
	yaht- see yat (YAK)
yaima noun "implement" (GL:37)
	yaimë noun "wailing", from which is derived the adjective yaimëa "wailing", pl. yaimië in Markirya

	yaiwë noun "mocking, scorn" (YAY)

	yallumë adv.? "at last" (FS)
	yalmë noun "clamour" (ÑGAL/ÑGALAM)
yaltë noun "bridge" (GL:37); rather yanta in Tolkien's later Quenya

	yalúmessë noun in locative "once upon a time" (locative form of yalúmë) (YA)
	yam- or yama- vb. “shout” (PE16:134, yamin, *”I shout”, QL:105), pa.t. yámë (QL:105)
	yámë adj.? "yawning" (MC:214; cf. the stem YAG in the Etymologies). Not to be confused with the past tense of yam-. 
	yan relative pronoun in dative "for/to which” or "for/to whom” (PE16:90, 92, 96). Used for “to whom" in the poem Nieninque; according to the system described elsewhere, which distinguishes personal ye “who" from impersonal ya "which", "to whom” would be *yen instead. – A wholly distinct ya(n) seems to appear as an ephemeral word for "as" in one version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer; see ya #2 (VT43:16, VT49:18)
	yána (1) adj. “vast, huge; wide” (PE17:99, 115); also yanda, q.v. 
	yána (2) noun "holy place, fane, sanctuary" (YAN). Compare ainas in a post-LotR source.

	yando adv. "also" (QL:104)
	yanga- vb. "to yawn" (YAG)
	yanta noun "bridge", also name of tengwa #35 (Appendix E); in the Etymologies, yanta is defined as "yoke" (YAT)
	yantya- vb. “add, augment” (PE15:68)
	yanwë noun "bridge, joining, isthmus" (YAT, “joining”, VT49:45, 46), changed by Tolkien from yanwa (VT46:22, VT49:34)
	yar inflected relative pronoun "to whom" (MC:215; this may be "Qenya", but on the other hand both the relative pronoun ya and an allativic ending -r are still valid in Tolkien's later Quenya, cf. mir "into". Later versions of the text in question however use yan [q.v.], with the common dative ending -n.) Likely, yar could also be the plural form of the relative pronoun ya, q.v.
	yár (yar-, as in dat.sg. yaren) noun "blood" (YAR; the Silmarillion appendix gives sercë instead. According to VT46:22, Tolkien introduced yór as a replacement form in the Etymologies itself.)
	yára adj. "ancient, belonging to or descending from former times" (YA); evidently it can also simply mean "old", since Tolkien used the intensive/superlative form #anyára to describe Elaine Griffiths as his *"oldest" or *"very old" friend in a book dedication (see an-).
	yárë noun "former days" (YA)
	yárëa adj. "olden" (YA)
	yáressë noun in locative "once upon a time" (locative form of yárë) (YA)
	yarra- noun "growl, snarl" (stem used as participle in Markirya, translated "snarling")
yaru noun "gloom, blight" (GL:37)
	#yassë (1) relative pronoun in locative "in which", pl. yassen referring back to a plural noun (relative pronoun ya + locative ending) (Nam, RGEO:66) 
	yassë (2) adv. "once upon a time" (YA); writers may rather use yalúmessë or yáressë of similar meaning to avoid confusion with # 1 above.
	yat (yaht-) noun "neck" (YAK)
	yatta noun "narrow neck, isthmus" (YAK). In the pre-classical Tengwar system presupposed in the Etymologies, yatta was also the name of tengwa #35, which letter Tolkien would later call yanta instead.
	yaulë noun "cat” (PE16:132). Compare mëoi.
	yav- vb. "bear fruit" (LT1:273, given in the form yavin and glossed "bears fruit"; this would have to mean "I bear fruit" in Tolkien's later Quenya: 1st pers. sg. aorist)
	yáva, yava see yávë
	yávan noun "harvest, autumn" (LT1:273; in LotR-style Quenya yávië)
	Yavanna, fem. name: Yav-anna, “Fruit-gift” (PE17:93) or "Fruit-giver", name of a Valië, spouse of Aulë, associated especially with plants (YAB, ANA1; cf. yávë)
yavannamírë noun "Yavanna-jewel", name of a tree with globed and scarlet fruits (UT:167)
Yavannië noun, name of the ninth month of the year, "September" (Appendix D, SA:yávë)
Yavannildi pl. noun "Followers of Yavanna" (sg. #Yavannildë?), Elvish women who knew and kept the secret of the making of coimas (lembas) (PM:404). Apparently Yavanna + hildi.
	yávë noun "fruit" (YAB), cf. Yavanna. Early "Qenya" has yáva (LT1:273); the form yava turns up even in later material (VT43:31)
	yávië noun "autumn" (SA:yávë); "autumn, harvest", in the calendar of Imladris a precisely defined period of 54 days, but also used without any exact definition (Appendix D). Noun yáviérë *"Autumn-day", a day outside the months in the Steward's Reckoning, inserted between Yavannië and Narquelië (September and October) (Appendix D)
	Yávien fem. name, apparently yávë "fruit" + the feminine ending -ien.
	yáwë noun "ravine, cleft, gulf" (YAG; according to VT46:22, the last gloss should perhaps be read as "gully" instead)
yaxë noun "milch cow", also yaxi "cow" (in Tolkien's later Quenya, the latter would probably be a plural) (GL:36)
	ye (1) singular personal relative pronoun "who", maybe also object "whom" (plural form i). Compare the impersonal form ya. Also attested in the genitive and the ablative cases: yëo and yello, both translated "from whom" (though the former would also mean *"whose, of whom"). (VT47:21)
	ye (2) copula "is" (FS, VT46:22); both earlier and later sources rather point to ná (q.v.) as the copula "is", so ye may have been an experiment Tolkien later abandoned. Future tense yéva, q.v.
	[ye (3), also yé, prep. "as" (VT43:16, struck out; in the text in question Tolkien finally settled on sívë, q.v.)]
	-yë (4) conj. "and" as a suffix added to the second of a pair, as Menel Cemenyë "Heaven and Earth" (VT47:30, 31, VT49:25). Other "pairs" are mentioned as examples but not actually translated into Quenya by Tolkien: Sun and Moon (*Anar Isilyë), Land and Sea (*Nór Eäryë), fire and water (*nárë nenyë, or *úr nenyë).
	yé (1) interjection "lo!" (VT47:31), also occurring in Aragorn's exclamation when he found the sapling of the White Tree. (Compare yéta-.) Also in the ejaculation yé mána (ma) = “what a blessing” or “what a good thing!“ (VT49:41). The more literal meaning would seem to be *“behold the blessing!”
	yé (2) conj.? "what is more", also yëa (VT47:31)
	[yé (3) = ye #3, q.v.]
	yëa conj.? "what is more", also yé (#2) (VT47:31)
	[yelca noun ?"sword" - Tolkien's gloss is not certainly legible, and the word was struck out anyway. (VT45:11)]
	[yelda] adj. "friendly, dear as friend" (YEL, struck out)
	yeldë noun "daughter" (YEL) This word was struck out in Etym, but it may have been restored together with the ending -iel, q.v.
	Yelin noun "winter" (LT1:260; LotR-style Quenya has hrívë, and Yelin was probably obsoleted together with the adjective yelwa "cold", that appears with a different meaning in the Etymologies).
	yello (1) relative pronoun in ablative: "from whom"; see ye #1.
	yello (2) noun "call, shout of triumph" (GYEL); changed by Tolkien from ello.
	**yelma, see yelmë.
	yelmë (1) noun "loathing". In the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry DYEL, the word appears as **yelma, but according to VT45:11 this is a misreading of Tolkien's manuscript. According to VT46:22, yelmë briefly appeared as a word for "daughter" (?)
	[yelmë] (2) noun (not glossed; the etymology may suggest *"friendship") (YEL, struck out)
	yelta- vb. "to loathe, abhor" (DYEL, VT45:11)
	yelwa (1) adj. "loathsome" (DYEL; according to VT45:11, Tolkien changed this word from yelva.)
	yelwa (2) adj. "cold" (LT1:260 – this "Qenya" word is apparently obsoleted by # 1 above. In LotR-style Quenya, the regular term for “cold” seems to be ringa.)
	yén noun, Elvish "long year" of 144 solar years, 52,596 days (Nam, Appendix D, E; RGEO:66. Tolkien earlier defined yén as 100 solar years; see PM:126. In the Etymologies, stem YEN, it seems to mean simply "year", but in the LotR Appendices the word for "year" instead appears as loa or coranar, q.v.) Yénonótië *"reckoning of years" (MR:51). Pl. yéni in Nam and Etym, entry YEN – though the plural form is misread as "yen-" in the printed version of the Etymologies, cf. VT46:23. Yéni pa yéni *”years upon years” (VT44:36). Pl. genitive yénion in yénion yéni "ages of ages" (VT44:36)
	yénië noun “annal(s)”; Yénië Valinórëo “Annals of Valinor” (MR:200)
	yen, yendë noun "daughter" (YŌ/YON). This word replaced another form, but this form may have been restored; see yeldë. In VT45:16, yendë is said to refer to a female "agent", a word changed by Tolkien from yendi, but Tolkien deleted all of this.
	[yendi]  noun "agent" (fem.; masc. [hendo]). The word yendi Tolkien changed to yendë before deleting all of this (VT45:16)
	yenya noun (or adv.?) "last year" (YA)
	yëo relative pronoun in genitive "from whom" (could also mean *"of whom"); see ye # 1.
	yérë noun *"sexual desire" (VT46:23; the word is not really glossed, but looks like an abstract formation from the stem YER "feel sexual desire")
	yerna adj. "old, worn" (GYER)
	yerya- vb. "to wear (out)", also intr. "get old" (GYER)
	yesta- (1) vb. "desire" (YES, VT46:23; the latter source indicates that Tolkien did write yesta- with a final hyphen, indicating that this is "desire" as a verbal stem, not as a noun). 
	yesta (2) noun “beginning” (PE17:120). Also attested in the compound yestarë (see below), but cf. esta #2. 
	yestarë noun *"beginning-day", the first day of the year (loa), immediately before the season of tuilë  (Appendix D, PE17:120)
	Yésus masc. name "Jesus" (Tolkien's Quenya spelling would seem to be based on the Latin pronunciation of the name) (VT43:31)
	yéta- vb. "look at" (LT1:262) Compare yé #1.
	yéva vb. "will be" (also "there will be"), apparently the future tense of ye (#2). Once translated "is" (írë ilqua yéva nótina, "when all is counted"), but this event belongs to the future; hence literally *"when all will be counted" (FS; VT46:22). In Tolkien's later Quenya, yéva was apparently replaced by nauva.
yo conj. “and”, “often used between two items (of any part of speech) that were by nature or custom clearly associated, like the names of spouses (Manwë yo Varda), or “sword and sheath” (*macil yo vainë), “bow and arrows” (*quinga yo pilindi), or groups like “Elves and Men” (Eldar yo Fírimor – but contrast eldain a fírimoin [dative forms] in FS, where Tolkien joins the words with a, seemingly simply a variant of the common conjunction ar). – In one source, yo is apparently a preposition "with" (yo hildinyar = *"with my heirs", SD:56). 
yó ("yô"), yond- see yondo. The genitive form of the relative pronoun ya “which” would likely also appear as yó “of which, from which” (for ya-o, cf. tó “thence” from ta-o). 
	yomenië noun "meeting, gathering" (of three or more coming from different directions) (WJ:407)
	Yón (1) noun "Son" (VT44:12, 17, referring to Jesus. Tolkien rewrote the text in question. Normally the Quenya word for "son" appears as yondo, which also refers to Jesus in one text.)
	yón (2), variant of yondë, q.v. Defined as “a region, any (fairly extensive) region between obstacles such as rivers or mountains” (PE17:43)
	yonda adj. “wide, roomy, extensive” (PE17:43), also (as alternative form of yonna) glossed “enclosed”, with the latter meaning perhaps intended as the passive participle of the verb yor-
	yondë noun “any fairly extensive region with well-marked natural bonds (as mountains or rivers)”, occurring as a suffix -yondë, -yon/-iondë, -ion in regional names. (PE17:43). Note: †yondë may also be an (archaic/poetic) past tense of the verb yor-, q.v.
	yondo noun "son" (YŌ/YON, VT43:37); cf. yonya and the patronymic ending -ion. Early "Qenya" has yô, yond-, yondo "son" (LT2:342). According to LT2:344, these are poetic words, but yondo seems to be the normal word for "son" in LotR-style Quenya. Yón appears in VT44, 17, but Tolkien rewrote the text in question. In LT2:344, yondo is said to mean "male descendant, usually (great) grandson", but in Tolkien's later Quenya, yondo means "son", and the word is so glossed in LT2:342. Dative yondon in VT43:36 (here the "son" in question is Jesus). See also yonya. – At one point, Tolkien rejected the word yondo as “very unsuitable” (for the intended meaning?), but no obvious replacement appeared in his writings (PE17:43), unless the (ephemeral?) form anon (q.v.) is regarded as such. In one source, yondo is also defined as “boy” (PE17:190).
	yonna adj. (or passive participle) “enclosed”, see yor-. (PE17:43)
	yonwa noun “fence, border, boundary” (PE17:43)
	yonya noun with pronominal ending "my son" (evidently short for *yondonya; the form yonya may be used as a form of address only) (LR:61)
	yonyo noun "son, big boy". In one version, yonyo was also a term used in children's play for "middle finger" or "middle toe", but Tolkien may have dropped this notion, deciding to use hanno "brother" as the alternative play-name (VT47:10, 15, VT48:4)
	yor- vb. “enclose, set bounds to/about” (PE17:43). Past tense yórë, †yondë, perfect oiórië (PE17:43). The forms yonda, yonna “enclosed” may be regarded as the passive participle of this verb.
	yór noun "blood"; see yár (VT46:22)
	yu- or yú- prefix "twi-" or "both" (VT45:13, VT46:23, VT48:20; see yualë, yúcalë, yurasta below). According to PE14:84, yú can function independently as the adverb “twice”.
	yualë noun "twilight" (KAL). Also yúcalë. Cf. yúyal. 
	yúcalë ("k") noun "twilight" (KAL, VT45:13). Also yualë.
	yúla noun "ember, smouldering wood" (YUL)
	yulda noun "draught, something drunk, a drink, the amount drunk", pl. yuldar (Nam, PE17:63, 68, RGEO:66). See -da regarding etymology.
	yulma (1) noun "cup" (Nam, RGEO:67), "drinking-vessel" (WJ:416, PE17:180). The plural form yulmar is attested (VT48:11). Yulmaya (“k”) colloquial Quenya for “his cup” (the formally correct form being *yulmarya) (VT49:17)
	yulma (2) noun "brand" (YUL). May have been obsoleted by # 1 above.
	yulmë (1) noun "drinking, carousal" (WJ:416)
	yulmë (2) noun "red [?heat]" (the gloss was illegible) (YUL)
yulu- vb. "carry" (GL:38; rather #col- in LotR-style Quenya)
yuncë ("k") cardinal "twelve", before it was altered to yunquë under the influence of minquë "eleven" (according to VT48:7, 8). The form yuncë is asterisked by Tolkien. Compare encë under enquë.
yunquë ("q") cardinal "twelve" (VT47:41, VT48:4, 6, 9; VT49:57; also compare the stem yunuk(w)- cited in VT42:24, 31). This word appears already in an early source (PE14:82). Some sources point to #rasta, q.v., as another word for "twelve". However, available post-LotR sources indicate that Tolkien intended yunquë as the regular Quenya word for "twelve".
yunquenta cardinal "thirteen" (12 and one more) (VT47:15), variant yunquentë (VT47:40), compare entë #1.
yunquesta fraction "one twelfth" (1/12) (VT48:11)
yur- vb. "run" (quoted in form yurin, translated "runs", but within Tolkien's later framework it looks like a 1st person aorist "I run") -QL:106 (cf. entry YUR in Etym)
yurasta cardinal "24" (two times #rasta "twelve") (PE14:17)
	yúyal noun “twilight” (PE17:169); cf. yualë, yúcalë, q.v.
	yúyo noun? adv.? "both" (YŪ, VT48:10). Used adjectivally in yúyo má “both hands”; notice that the noun following yúyo receives no plural or dual marker.

<Z>
	-zya, archaic form of the pronominal ending -rya “his, her, its”, q.v. (VT49:17)
