  † = poetic or archaic word  (e.g. †él "star", elen being the ordinary word) or a poetic or archaic meaning of an ordinary word (e.g. russë "corruscation, †swordblade"), * = unattested form, ** = wrong form, # = word that is only attested in a compound or in an inflected form (e.g. #apa, #Apanóna; see AFTER below), TLT = Tolkien's lifetime (by some called "Real Time", as opposed to:) MET = Middle-Earth Time (or rather Arda Time, since Quenya originated in the Blessed Realm), LotR = The Lord of the Rings (HarperCollinsPublishers, one-volume edition of 1991), Silm = The Silmarillion (HarperCollinsPublishers 1994), MC = The Monsters and the Critics and other Essays, MR = Morgoth's Ring, LR = The Lost Road, Etym = The Etymologies (in LR:347-400), FS = Fíriel's Song (in LR:72), RGEO = The Road Goes Ever On  (Second Edition), TI = The Treason of Isengard, WJ = The War of the Jewels,  PM = The Peoples of Middle-earth, Letters = The Letters of J. R. R. Tolkien, LT1 = The Book of Lost Tales 1, LT2 = The Book of Lost Tales 2, Nam = Namárië (in LotR:398), Arct = "Arctic" sentence  (in The Father Christmas Letters), GL = Gnomish Lexicon (in Parma Eldalamberon [PE] #11 – references are selective), QL = Qenya Lexicon (in Parma Eldalamberon #12 – references are again selective), VT = Vinyar Tengwar  (PE and VT being journals publishing Tolkien material edited by C. Gilson, C.F. Hostetter,  A.R. Smith,  W. Welden and P.

The spelling used in this wordlist is regularized (c for k except in a few names, x for ks, long vowels marked with accents rather than macrons or circumflexes;  the diaeresis is used as in LotR).  When s in a word represents earlier Þ (th as in "thing") and it should be spelt with the letter súlë instead of silmë in Tengwar writing (though Tolkien himself sometimes ignored or forgot this), this is indicated by (Þ) immediately following the word in question (e.g. sanda, sanya-; see ABIDE, ABIDING below).
  
Wordlist last updated December 17, 2008

<A>
  A, AN (indefinite article) – no Quenya equivalent. Elen "star" may thus also be translated "a star" (LotR:94), Elda “Elf” is also the equivalent of “an Elf” (Letters:281). Sometimes Tolkien inserts “a” before a gloss to indicate that a noun rather than a verb is intended: rista “a cut” (RIS), vanta “a walk” (BAT). The word laurë Tolkien translated as “(a) golden light”, indicating that “a” has no equivalent in Quenya (VT49:47). The absence of the definite article i "the" usually indicates that the noun is indefinite (though there are exceptions – see THE).
  ABANDON hehta- (pa.t. hehtanë is given) (put aside, leave out, exclude, forsake) –WJ:365
  ABHOR feuya-, yelta- (loathe); THE ABHORRED Sauron (Þ) –PHEW/VT46:9, Silm:418, VT45:11
  ABIDE mar- (be settled of fixed) (fut. #maruva is attested: maruvan "I will abide"); ABIDE BY himya- (cleave to, stick to, adhere); ABIDING sanda (Þ) (firm, true); LAW-ABIDING sanya (Þ) (regular, normal) (variant vorosanya with a prefixed element meaning "ever"). –UT:317/LotR:1003, KHIM/VT45:22, STAN/VT46:16
  ABLE, BE; see BE ABLE
  ABOVE: According to VT44:26, Tolkien in one text glosses apa as "above but touching", but apa is normally taken as the preposition "after" instead. For "above", the preposition or "over" may be used.
  ABUNDANCE úvë; ABUNDANT úvëa (in a very great number), úmëa (swarming, teaming – but elsewhere a similar word is defined as "evil", so úvëa may be preferred), alya (rich, blessed, prosperous) –UB, VT48:32, GALA
  ABUSE (vb, evidently meaning to abuse verbally) naitya- (put to shame) –QL:65
  ABYSS undumë –MC:222 cf. 215
  ACCOMODATE camta- (sic; the cluster mt seems unusual for Quenya, and while the source does not explicitly say that this word is Quenya, it is difficult to understand what other language could be intended) (to [make] fit, suit, adapt) –VT44:14
  ACCOUNT (noun) quentalë (history), lúmequenta (chronological account, history); HISTORICAL ACCOUNT quentasta (any particular arrangement, by some author, of a series of reconds or evidences into a given historical account – not History as such, which is quentalë) –KWET, LU, VT39:16
  ACCURSED húna (cursed). –PE17:149
  ACRE resta (sown field) –VT46:11 cf. RED
  ACROSS arta (athwart) (Note: arta also means "fort, fortress"; the word olla may be a better word for *“across” in Tolkien’s later forms of Quenya; see OVER) –LT2:335
  ACT OF WILL nirmë –VT39:30
  ACTOR tyaro (agent, doer) –KYAR
  ACTUAL anwa (real, true), nanwa (existing, true) –ANA, VT49:30
  ACUTE tereva (fine, piercing); ACUTE, ACUTENESS laicë (In the printed Etymologies, a similar word is also the adjective "keen, sharp, acute", but according to VT45:25, this is a misreading; the final vowel of the adjective should be -a, not -ë. However, the conceptual validity of the adjective laica, and therefore also the corresponding noun laicë, is questionable; see PIERCING.) –TER, LAIK
  ADAPT camta- (sic; the cluster mt seems unusual for Quenya; while the source does not explicitly say that this word is Quenya, it is difficult to understand what other language could be intended) (to [make] fit, suit, accomodate) –VT44:14
  ADD napan-, yantya- (augment) –PE17:146, 15:68
  ADHERE himya- (abide by, cleave to, stick to) –VT45:22, cf. KHIM
  ADHERING himba (sticking) –KHIM
  ADMIRAL ciryatur (only attested as the personal name Ciryatur of an admiral, but the word means *"ship-ruler") –UT:239
  ADORN netya- (trim). (Note: netya is also an adj. "pretty, dainty".) SMALL THING OF PERSONAL ADORNMENT netil –VT47:33
  ADULT (adj) vëa (manly, vigorous); ADULT MAN vëaner; ADULT MALE nér (ner-, as in. pl neri) (man) –WEG, DER
  ADÛNAKHOR Herunúmen –UT:222, Silm:322
  AEGNOR Aicanáro (so in Silm:435 and PM:345; MR:323 has Aicanár) (Sharp Flame, Fell Fire) 
  AFFECT #ap- (given as aorist stem apë) (to concern, to touch one) –VT44:26
  AFFECTIONATE méla (loving) –VT39:10
  AFFLICTED – be afflicted: moia- (labour). The participle *moiala may then be used to translate "afflicted" as an adjective, describing one who is "labouring" or toiling as a thrall. –VT43:31
  AFTER apa (also attested in compounds like Apanónar, see below), #ep- (used in compounds when the second part of the compound begins with a vowel, only attested in epessë "after-name" – see NICKNAME.) This ep- is a shorter form of epë, which means “before” of spatial relationships but “after” of time (since the Eldar imagined time coming after their present as being before them, VT49:12); apa and epë may be seen as variants of the same word. Other variant forms of apa "after" include opo and pó/po (VT44:36, VT49:12). According to VT44:26, the preposition apa may also appear as pa, pá (cf. yéni pa yéni "years after years" in VT44:35), but pa/pá is in other manuscripts defined as "touching, as regards, concerning". THE AFTER-BORN Apanónar (sg #Apanóna) (i.e., an Elvish name of Men, according to WJ:387 "a word of lore, not used in daily speech") –Silm:122/WJ:387, UT:266
  AGAIN ata; AGAIN (prefix) en-, (prefix) at-, ata- (back-, re-) (AT[AT])
  AGAINST: According to VT44:26, Tolkien in some documents glosses apa or pá as "touching, against", but apa is normally the preposition "after" instead (see AFTER). The allative case in -nna is normally sufficient to express motion towards or against something. Possibly this ending can also take on the meaning of “against” with connotations of enmity and confrontation, as when the pl. allative valannar is used in the phrase *“made war on/against the Valar” (LR:47).
  AGE randa (cycle) (as in “the Third Age”; not the age of a person); AGES OF AGES yénion yéni –RAD, VT44:36
  AGENT tyaro (actor, doer) –KAR
  AGILE tyelca (swift) –KYELEK
  AGO yá; LONG AGO andanéya, anda né (once upon a time) –YA, VT49:31
  AGONY qualmë (death), unqualë (death; according to VT45:24, Tolkien changed this word to anqualë) –KWAL, VT45:5, 24, 36
  AH (interj.) ai (alas) Ai! laurië lantar lassi Ah! golden fall the leaves (Nam)
  AIR vista (= air as substance); vilya older [MET] wilya (sky); vilma (lower air) (perhaps changed to vista, but vilma was not struck out in Etym); lindë (tune, song, singing); PUFF OF AIR hwesta (breeze, breath); UPPER AIRS AND CLOUDS fanyarë (skies), AIRY vilin (breezy) –WIS, WIL/LT1:273, LIN, SWES/LotR:1157, MC:223, LT1:273
  ALAS (interj.) ai (ah) (Etym also gives a word nai, but this clashes with nai "be it that" in Namárië.); also orro or horro as an "exclamation of horror, pain, disgust: ugh, alas! ow!" –Nam/RGEO:66, NAY, VT45:17
  ALIKE véla –VT49:10 
  ALIVE cuina; BEING ALIVE (noun not adj) cuilë (life) (LT1:257 gives coina, coirëa; see LIVING) –KUY
  ALL illi (as independent noun), also ilya (all of a particular group of things, the whole, each, every) (Note: ilya normally appears as ilyë before a plural noun: ilyë tier "abll paths"); ALLNESS, THE ALL ilúvë (the whole). According to early material, ALL THE... (followed by some noun) is rendered by i quanda, e.g. *i quanda cemen "all the earth; the whole earth". ALL THAT IS WANTED fárë, farmë (plenitude, sufficiency) –VT47:30, VT39:20, VT44:9, IL, Nam cf. RGEO:67, Silm:433/WJ:402, QL:70, PHAR/VT46:9
  ALLOW lav- (yield, grant); NOT ALLOW TO CONTINUE nuhta- (stunt, prevent from coming to completion, stop short) –DAB, WJ:413
  ALONE (see also LONELY, SOLE) er (one, alone, only, but, still), eressë (singly, only, also as noun: solitude) –ERE, LT1:269
  ALPHABET tengwanda –TEK
  ALSO yando –QL:104
  ALTHOUGH (or "nothwithstanding") – Christopher Gilson argues that the word ómu occurring in an untranslated "Qenya" text could have this meaning (PE15:32, 37). If this interpretation is regarded as too uncertain, the idea expressed by phrases involving "(al)though" may be rephrased using ananta "and yet" (e.g. "although the house is small, we love it" > *i coa pitya ná, ananta melilmes = "the house is small, and yet we love it").
  ALWAYS illumë (earlier variants of the relevant text also have vora and vorë, forms Tolkien may or may not have abandoned) –VT44:9
  ALTOGETHER aqua (fully, completely, wholly) –WJ:392
 *AMANIAN (only translated "of Aman" by Tolkien) amanya (which can also mean “blessed”, VT49:41). Cf. also Úmanyar, Úamanyar, Alamanyar "those not of Aman" (the Elves who started on the march from Cuiviénen but did not reach Aman; contrast the Avamanyar, another name of the Avari.) –WJ:411, 373, 370, MR:163
  AMBIDEXTROUS ataformaitë (pl. ataformaiti is attested) –VT49:10
  AMEN (Hebrew: "truly, certainly, may it be so") násië (another form, násan, was apparently abandoned by Tolkien) –VT43:24, 35
  AMLOTH *Ambalotsë (Tolkien asterisked the word because it was not "attested", only a possible Quenya form of Amloth. See "UPRISING-FLOWER".) –WJ:318
  AMONG imíca, mici; see also BETWEEN. –VT43:30
  AMRAS Telufinwë (meaning "Last Finwë", not the equivalent in sense to his Sindarin name. The short form of his name was Telvo *"Last One". His mother-name [q.v.] was Ambarussa, but this name was not used in narrative.) –PM:353
  AMROD Pityafinwë (meaning "Little Finwë", not the equivalent in sense to his Sindarin name. The short form of his name was Pityo *"Little One". His mother-name [q.v.] was Ambarto, or Umbarto, but these names were not used in narrative.) –PM:353
  AN see A
  ANCIENT yára (old, belonging to or descending from former times) –YA
  AND ar. In the phrase eldain a fírimoin “to Elves and Men” (FS), ar is seemingly reduced to a before f, but contrast ar formenna *“and northwards” in VT49:26. (In Sauron Defeated  p. ii, the word o is translated  "and", but LotR, Silm and Etym all agree that the Quenya word for "and" is ar. A longer variant arë is mentioned in VT43:31.) A suffix meaning "and", -yë, occurs in the phrase Menel Cemenyë "heaven and earth" (VT47:11); this suffix is "normally used of pairs usually associated as Sun, Moon [*Anar Isilyë]; Heaven, Earth [Menel Cemenyë], Land, Sea [*Nór Eäryë], fire, water [*úr nenyë]" (VT47:31). AND YET a-nanta/ananta (but yet) –AR/Nam/FS, VT43:31, NDAN; the etymology of ar is discussed in VT47:31
  ANGBAND Angamando (Iron-gaol) (so in MR:350 and Silm:428; Etym has Angamanda, or in deleted material Angavanda). –MR:350, Silm:428, MBAD, VT45:6
  ANGELIC POWER Vala (pl. Valar or Vali, gen. pl. Valion is attested in Fíriel's Song); ANGELIC SPIRIT Ainu, f. Aini (holy one, god) –LotR:1157/BAL/FS, AYAN, LT1:248
  ANGELN (island in the Danish peninsula) Eriollo –LT1:252
  ANGER, ANGRY, see WRATH, WRATHFUL
  ANGROD Angaráto –Silm:428
  ANIMAL #celva (only pl. celvar is attested, translated "animals, living things that move" in Silm appendix and WJ:341); laman (pl. lamni or lamani) ("usually only applied to four-footed beasts, and never to reptiles and birds"); MALE ANIMAL hanu (male) –Silm:52/53,/405:3AN, WJ:416
  ANNOUNCEMENT canwa (order) –PM:362
  ANOTHER enta (one more). (Note: a homophone means "that yonder"). See also OTHER. –VT47:15
  ANYBODY – if anybody: aiquen (whoever); ANYONE mo (but this is also used as an impersonal pronoun “one”) –WJ.372, VT49:32
  APPLE orva –PE13:116
  APPROPRIATE (to a special purpose or owner) #sat- (set aside). The verb #sat- is cited in the form "sati-", evidently including the connecting vowel of the aorist, as in *satin "I appropriate". –VT42:20
  APRIL Víressë –LotR:1144/1146
  AR-ADÛNAKHOR Tar-Herunúmen –UT:222, Silm:322
  AR-BELZAGAR Tar-Calmacil –UT:222
  AR-GIMILZÔR Tar-Telemnar –UT:223
  AR-INZILADÛN Tar-Palantir –UT:223, Silm:324
  AR-PHARAZÔN Tar-Calion (and, as an experimental form, Tar-culu?) –UT:224, Silm:324, VT45:24
  AR-SAKALTHÔR Tar-Falassion –UT:223
  AR-ZIMRAPHEL Tar-Míriel –UT:224, Silm:324
  AR-ZIMRATHÔN Tar-Hostamir –UT:222
  ARCH cú (crescent). –KU3
  ARCTURUS (a star) Morwinyon (said to mean "the glint at dusk" or "glint in the dark") –LT1:260
  ARE see BE
  ARGON Aracáno –PM:345
  ARM ranco (stem *rancu-, pl. ranqui) (LT2:335 gives rá [there spelt râ], but this is apparently rendered obsolete by a later word in Tolkien’s conception: In Etym, rá is glossed "lion".) TRUNCATED ARM, see STUB, STUMP. –RAK
  ARMY hossë (band, troop) –LT2:340
  ARNOR Arnanor, Arnanórë ("royal land") –Letters:428
  ARRANGEMENT pano (plan). Note: the word also means “piece of shaped wood”. –QL.72
  ARRIVE: The verb ten- is used for this meaning in one source (present tense téna “is on point of arrival, is just coming to the end”). Other attested forms are tenë (aorist; 1st person tenin), pa.t. tennë “arrived, reached” (“usually used with locative not allative”: tennen sís “I arrive[d] here”), perfect eténië, future tenuva “will arrive”. Tolkien subsequently changed ten- to men-, but the latter is elsewhere ascribed the meaning “go”. –VT49:23-24
  ARROW pilin (pilind-, as in the pl. pilindi) –PÍLIM
  ART Carmë (making, production); BLACK ARTS núlë (sorcery). (The word is spelt “ñúle” in the source, reflecting the older pronunciation; in Tengwar spelling the initial nasal should therefore be represented by the letter Noldo). –UT:396, PE17:125
  ARTIFICIAL CAVE hróta (dwelling underground, rockhewn hall) –PM:365
  AS (prep) ve (like). The longer variant sívë appears to introduce a comparison with something that is near to the point or thought of the speaker, whereas tambë introduces a comparison with something remote, as in Tolkien's translation of one line from the Lord's Prayer: cemendë tambë Erumandë "on earth as in heaven" ("heaven" being remote – we may theorize that "in heaven as [here] on earth" would translate as *Erumandë sívë cemendë, since "earth" would represent the position of the speaker). NOTE: a homophone sívë means "peace". The word yan, related to the relative ya “which”, is also defined “as” in one text (VT49:18). AS REGARDS pa, pá (concerning, touching). AS USUAL ve senwa (also ve senya, but see USUAL). –Nam/RGEO:66, 67, VT43:12, 38, VT44:26, VT49:22
  ASCENT rosta, ASCENSION orosta –LT1:267, 256
  ASGARD Valinor, Valinórë (Tolkien actually uses this gloss of Valinor, as Asgard is the City of the Gods in Norse mythology) –LT1:272
  ASIDE – stand aside! heca! – also with pronominal affixes: sg hecat, pl hecal "you stay aside!" (be gone!) LEAVING ASIDE hequa (not counting, excluding, except) –WJ:364, 365
 *ASK #maquet- (only pa.t. maquentë is attested. The word is not translated, but undoubtedly means "asked": 'Mana i·coimas in·Eldaron?' maquentë Elendil [PM:403]. The question itself is translated "What is the coimas of the Eldar?", so the rest must be "Elendil asked". Furthermore, maquentë is transparently quentë "said" with the interrogative element ma [PM:357] prefixed.) ASK FOR – see DEMAND.
  ASLEEP lorna –LOS
  ASSEMBLE (transitive) comya- (gather), hosta- (gather, collect) –PE17:158, MC:223
  ASSOCIATE (noun) otorno (sworn brother) osellë (Þ) (sworn sister) –TOR, THEL
  ASTRONOMER meneldil –Letters:386
  AT sé, se (the form with a long vowel may be preferred since se is apparently also a 3rd person pronoun) (in). The locative case may also express “at”, e.g. lúmissen “at the times”. –VT43:30, 34, VT49:47
  ATHELAS (a healing plant) asëa; see KINGSFOIL. –PE148
  ATHWART arta (across) (Note: arta also means "fort, fortress"); GO ATHWART tara- (cross) –LT2:335, 347    
  AUGER teret (gimlet) –LT1:255
  AUGMENT (vb.) yantya- (add) –PE15:68
  AUGUST Urimë (so in LotR; UT has Úrimë) –LotR:1144, UT:302/470
  AUTHORITY Máhan (pl Máhani is given, but seems perfectly regular). Tolkien once stated that Valar should strictly be translated "the Authorities" (MR:350), but Vala obviously cannot be used to translate "authority" in general; it was used only of the Valar themselves (WJ:404). Cf. also adj. valya "having (divine) authority or power". Máhani was adopted from Valarin and originally probably referred to the Valar themselves. We are not told whether Máhan could or should be applied to a non-divine authority (at least it should not be capitalized if so used). Note: Máhan means *"Supreme One" rather than "authority" as an abstract. –MR:350, BAL, WJ:399/402
  AUTUMN yávië (harvest – in the Calendar of Imladris, yávië was a precisely defined period of 54 days, but the word was also used without any exact definition), lasselanta ("leaf-fall", used of the beginning of winter or as a synonym of quellë; see FADING. Also spelt lasse-lanta with a hyphen), narquelion ("fire-fading" – this word from Fíriel's Song and Etym seems to correspond to narquelië in LotR, but the latter is the name of the month corresponding to our October.) LT1:273 has yávan "autumn, harvest", but this word may be obsoleted by yávië. –LotR:1142, 1144, 1145/Silm:439/LT1:254, DAT, FS, NAR/KWAL, Letters:382
  AVENGE ahtar- or accar- (do back, react; requite) –PE17:166
  AVENUE OF TREES aldëon –LT1:249
  AWAKE coiva- (so in LT1:257; read *cuiva- in Tolkien's later Quenya? Cf. the following:) AWAKENING (noun) cuivië (obsoleting coivië in LT1:257), cuivë; AWAKENING (adj) cuivëa –KUY/Silm:429
  AWKWARD hranga (hard; stiff, difficult). Note: hranga- is also a verb “thwart”. –PE17:154, 185
  AWAY oa, oar (viewed from the point of view of the thing, person, or place left). Oar is used of movement only, as in "I went away". See also GO AWAY. –WJ:366 cf. 361, VT39:6. 
  AWNING teltassë –GL:70
  AXE pelecco –LT2:346  

  <B>
  BABE lapsë; BABY winë (stem *wini-; Exilic Quenya *vinë, *vini-), in another source defined as "child not yet fully grown". Also winimo (Exilic *vinimo) or winicë, wincë (Exilic *vinicë, *vincë). These terms were also used in children's play for "little finger" or "little toe". –LAP, VT47:10, 26, VT48:7
  BACK (noun) pontë (ponti-) (rear) (QL:75) LT2:338 mentions a Gnomish word alm, said to mean "the broad of the back from shoulder to shoulder, back, shoulders". It is stated that the "Qenya" cognate of this Gnomish word occurs in the name Aikaldamor – i.e., #aldamo or #aldamor? (Aldama appears as a word for "shoulder" in PE13:109, cf. 137.)  But this is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. 
  BACK- (prefix) at-, ata- (re-, again-), also see BACKWARDS. Cf. also DO BACK ahtar- or accar-  (react, requite, avenge); these forms represent older at-kar-. THOSE WHO GO BACK Nandor (Elves that left the March from Cuiviénen) AT BACK OF PLACE, see BEHIND. –AT(AT), PE17:166, WJ:384
  BACKWARDS nan- (prefix), as in *nanquerna “turned back” –NDAN, VT49:20
  BAD olca (wicked) (VT43:24). Compare ulca "evil". The Gnomish fêg is glossed "bad" in GL:34, and this is equated with Q faica, glossed "contemptible, mean" under SPAY in the Etymologies.
  BAKE masta- –MBAS
  BALE OUT calpa- (draw water, scoop out) –KALPA
  BALL coron (stem #corn-, as in dat.sg. cornen) (globe) –KOR
  BALROG Valarauco (pl. Valaraucar, possibly reflecting an alternative form *Valarauca) (so in the Silmarillion – in Etym the Quenya form of Sindarin balrog is malarauco, while LT1:250 gives Malcaraucë) –Silm:35/425/439, RUK
  BAND nossë (army, troop) –LT2:340
  BANK (esp. of river) ráva –RAMBÁ
  BARK (noun) – Tolkien originally thought that parma "book" really meant "skin, bark; parchment", with "book, writings" as the secondary meaning. But in Etym parma is derived from a stem meaning "compose, put together", obsoleting the old etymology. –LT2:346, contrast PAR
  BARN FOWL porocë (hen) –PE16:132
  BASE sundo (Þ) (root, root-word) (pl. #sundar, isolated from Tarmasundar in UT:166), talan (talam-) (floor, ground), talma (foundation, root); BASE-STRUCTURE sundocarmë (Þ) –SUD (but VT46:16 indicates that Tolkien changed the root to STUD, hence implying that sundo was originally Þundo), WJ:319, TALAM, TAL, LT:343
  BATHING (noun) sovallë (washing, purification) –QL:86
  BATTER palpa- (beat) –PALAP
  BAY (small and landlocked) hópa (haven, harbour) –KHOP
  BE: Quenya uses forms of ná as the copula used to join adjectives, nouns or pronouns “in statements (or wishes) asserting (or desiring) a thing to have certain quality, or to be the same as another” (VT49:28). It may also denote a position, as in tanomë nauvan “I will be there” (VT49:19). PE17:68 mentions návë “being” as a “general infinitive” form; the gloss would suggest that návë may also be regarded as a gerund. Present tense ná “is” (Nam), pl. nar or nár ”are" (PE15:36, VT49:27, 30), dual nát (VT49:30). Also attested with various pronominal endings: nányë/nanyë “I am”, nalyë or natyë “you (sg.) are” (polite and familiar, respectively), nás “it is”, násë “(s)he is”, nalmë “we are” (VT49:27, 30). Some forms listed in VT49:27 are perhaps intended as aorist forms (nain “I am”, naityë/nailyë “you are”); VT49:30 however lists aorist forms with no intruding i (nanyë *“I am”,  nalyë *”thou art”, ná “is”, nassë *”(s)he is”, nalmë *“we are”, nar “are”).  Pa.t. nánë or né “was”, pl. náner/nér and dual nét “were” (VT49:6, 10, 27, 30). According to VT49:31, né “was” cannot receive pronominal endings (though nésë “he was” is attested elsewhere, VT49:28-29), and such endings are rather added to the form ane-, e.g. anen “I was”, anel “you were”, anes “(s)he/it was” (VT49:28). Future tense nauva "will be" (VT42:34, VT49:19; alternative form uva only in VT49:30) Perfect anaië “has been” (VT49:27, first written as anáyë). The form na may be used as imperative (na airë "be holy", VT43:14, alcar...na Erun "glory...be to God", VT44:34); this imperative na is apparently incorporated in the word nai "be it that" (misleading translation "maybe" in LotR). This nai can be combined with a verb to express a hope that something will happen (Nam: nai hiruvalyë Valimar, “may you find Valimar”) or if the verb is in the present rather than the future tense, that it is already happening (VT49:39: nai Eru lye mánata “God bless you” or *”may God be blessing you”). According to PE17:58, imperative na is short for á na with the imperative particle included. – Ná "is" appears with a short vowel (na) in some sources, but writers should probably maintain the long vowel to avoid confusion with the imperative na (and with the wholly distinct preposition na "to"). The short form na- may however be usual before pronominal suffixes. By one interpretation, na with a short vowel represents the aorist (VT49:27). – The word ëa is variously translated "is", "exists", "it is", "let it be". It has a more absolute meaning than ná, with reference to existence rather than being a mere copula. It may also be used (with prepositional phrases) to denote a position: i ëa han ëa “[our Father] who is beyond [the universe of] Eä” (VT43:12-14), i Eru i or ilyë mahalmar ëa “the One who is above all thrones” (UT:305). The pa.t. of this verb is engë, VT43:38, perfect engië or rarely éyë, future euva, VT49:29. – Fíriel's Song contains a word ye "is" (compare VT46:22), but its status in LotR-style Quenya is uncertain. – NOT BE, NOT DO: Also attested is the negative copula uin and umin "I do not, am not" (1st pers. aorist), pa.t. úmë. According to VT49:29, forms like ui “it is not”, uin(yë) “I am not”, uil(yë) *“you are not”, *uis *”(s)he is not” and uilmë *”we are not” are cited in a document dating from about 1968, though some of this was struck out. The monosyllable ú is used for “was not” in one text. The negation lá can be inflected for time “when verb is not expressed”. Tense-forms given: (aorist) lanyë “I do not, am not”; the other forms are cited without pronominal suffixes: present laia, past lánë, perfect alaië, future lauva, imperative ala, alá. MAY IT BE SO, see AMEN.  –VT49:27-34, Nam/RGEO:67, VT43:34/An Introduction to Elvish:5, VT42:34,Silm:21/391, FS, UGU/UMU, VT49:13
  BE ABLE (and the English present tense can) is expressed by various verbs: pol- (to be physically able), lerta- (be free to do, there being no restraint, physical or other), ista- (know how to; pa.t. sintë), hence e.g. polin quetë “I can speak” (because mouth and tongue are free), lertan quetë "I can/may speak” (because I am free to do so, there being no obstacle of promise, secrecy, or duty), istan quetë “I can/know how to speak” (I have learnt language). Where the absence of a physical restraint is considered, the verb lerta- can be used in much the same sense as pol- (VT41:6). Another way of expressing “can” involves the verb ec-, and what would be the subject in English appears in the dative case instead: Ecë nin carë sa, “I can do it” (it is possible for me to do it), ecuva nin carë sa “I may do that” (in the future). –VT49:20, 34
  BE GONE! heca! – also with pronominal affixes: sg hecat, pl hecal "you be gone!" (stand aside!) –WJ:364
  BEACH falas (falass-), falassë (shore, line of surf), falas, hresta (ablative hrestallo is attested), fára (shore). –LT1:253, Silm:431, PHAL/LT2:339, MC:221/222/223, VT46:15
  BEAR (vb) #col- (verb stem isolated from #colindo "bearer". Cf. mel- "to love", melindo "lover"). #Col- can also be translated *"wear" [of clothes], cf. the past participle colla "borne, worn". BEAR FRUIT yavin (which must mean *"I bear fruit", stem #yav-. Tolkien often employs the 1st person aorist when mentioning a verb in his wordlists.) –LotR:989, cf. Letters:308 and MEL, MR:385, LT1:273
  BEAR (noun) morco –MORÓK
  BEARD fanga (obsoleting vanga in GL:21; GL:34 has fangë "long beard", whereas GL:63 gives poa. Neo-Quenya writers should use fanga.) –SPÁNAG
  BEARER #colindo (only attested in the pl compound cormacolindor "Ring-bearers") –LotR:989, cf. Letters:308
  BEAST (wild beast) hravan –PE17:78
  BEAT palpa- (batter) –PALAP
  BEAUTIFUL vanya (Note: a homophone verb means "disappear"), linda (beautiful/fair of sound, VT45:27), calwa, vanima (fair, proper, right) (nominal pl vanimar "beautiful ones" and partitive plural genitive vanimálion are attested). According to MR:49, Maiar means "the Beautiful", but in Quenya this is the name of an order of spirits and cannot be used as a general adjective. BEAUTY vanessë, WITHOUT BEAUTY úvanë, adj. úvanëa –BAN, SLIN, LT1:254, LotR:1017 cf. Letters:308, LT1:272, MR:49, VT39:14
  BECAUSE, see SINCE
  BED caima; BEDCHAMBER caimasan (Þ) (#caimasamb-, as in pl. caimasambi); BEDRIDDEN caila (lying in bed, ?sickness), caimassëa (sick); LYING IN BED (noun) caila (bedridden, ?sickness) –KAY/VT45:19, STAB
  BEE nier (honey-bee), nion –GL:60
  BEECH feren, fernë (pl. ferni in both cases) (LT2:343 gives neldor "beech", but this early word may be obsolete in LotR-style Quenya.) –PHER
  BEECHEN ferinya –PHÉREN
  BEFORE (prep.) epë (VT44:38, VT49:12), used of spatial relationships. Of time the word means “after” (cf. the gloss in VT42:32), since the Eldar imagined future time (time that comes after the present) as being “before” them (see AFTER). BEFORE of time may instead be expressed by nó (VT49:32), e.g. *cennelmet nó té cenner mé “we saw them before they saw us”. For “before” as an independent adverb (= “formerly”), it may be best to use yá “formerly” or derive an adverb *noavë from the adj. noa (see FORMER). BEFORE, IN FRONT OF (of spatial relationships) opo, pó (VT49:12)
  BEGET nosta- (glossed "give birth" in earlier sources), onta- (pa.t. ónë or ontanë) (create); BEGETTER #nostar (see note below), also ontar with gender-specific forms ontaro (m.), ontarë or ontari (f.) (parent). (In LotR, the form nostari "begetters, parents" occurs; sg #nostar. Nostari was changed from ontari in Tolkien's first draft [see SD:73], so he may have scrapped ontaro, ontarë in favour of #nostar [or m. *nostaro, f. *nostarë???] Did he also reject the verb onta- in favour of nosta-?) –SD:73, VT44:7, ONO, LotR:1017 cf. Letters:308
  BEGINNING yesta (In the Etymologies there also appeared the word esse, derived from a stem ESE, ESET that was marked with a query by Tolkien because esse also means “name”. The later word yesta would suggest that he changed the stem in question to *YES, *YESET.) –PE17:120, ESE/ESET
  BEGOTTEN – see FIRST-BEGOTTEN.
  BEHALF – on behalf of: rá, followed by dative, as in the example rá men "on behalf of us, for us". Dative pronouns may be directly suffixed to rá: "for us" or "on behalf of us" is also attested in the one-word form rámen. (Note: rá is also a noun "lion".) –VT43:27, 28, 33
  BEHIND ca, cata, cana (also glossed "at back of place") –VT43:20 
  BEHOLD cen- (see) (future tense cenuva is attested) –MC:222
  BEING ëala (spirit).Pl. ëalar is attested. Eälar are spirits whose natural state it is to exist without a physical body, e.g. Balrogs. –MR:165
  BEING ALIVE (noun) cuilë –KUY
  BELEGOST Túrosto (Mickleburg) –WJ:389
  BELERIAND Hecelmar, Heceldamar (lit. *"home of the Eglath", q.v.) This is said to be the name for Beleriand used "in the language of the loremasters of Aman". The cognate of Sindarin "Beleriand" is #Valariandë; only the form Valarianden is attested (a genitive formation from an earlier "Qenya" variant; in LotR-style Quenya it would be a dative). The latter may be the name used in Exilic Quenya. Beleriand was also called Ingolondë "Land of the Gnomes [Noldor]". –WJ:365, LR:202, ÑGOLOD
  BELIEVE sav-. This verb is used = “believe (that statements, reports, traditions, etc. are) true, accept as fact” (VT49:27; the first person aorist savin is given). Not used with a person as object (in the sense of believing that this person tells the truth); with a noun, name or pronoun as object, sav- implies “I believe that he/she/it really exists/existed”. To “believe in” someone meaning “believe that (s)he tells the truth” can be paraphrased as (for instance) savin Elesarno quetië “I believe in Elessar’s words” (lit. speaking). –VT49:27-28
  BELL nyellë –NYEL
  BELLIED #cumba (isolated from sauricumba "foulbellied"). This adjective may point to *cumbo or something similar as the likely word for "belly". –SD:68, 72
  BELOVED melda (dear, sweet). Cf. nessamelda, *"beloved of Nessa", a fragrant evergreen tree brought to Númenor by the Eldar. –MEL, UT:456
  BELT quilta (girdle) –QL:78
  BELZAGAR Calmacil –UT:222
  BEND #cúna- (derived from the adj. cúna "bent"; see MC:223. In menel acúna "the heavens bending" the word is used intransitively.) –MC:222/223 cf. 215   
  BENEATH undu (down, under) –UNU
  BENEFICIAL asëa (Þ) (helpful, kindly) (so according to a late note where the word is derived from *ATHAYA). Also (as noun) used as the name of the healing plant called in Sindarin athelas.
  BENT cúna (curved; cúna is also used as a verbal stem, see BEND), raica (crooked, wrong), cauca (crooked, humped), sara (Þ) (stiff dry grass) –MC:223, RAYAK, LT1:257, STAR
  BERRY piucca –GL:64 (glossed "blackberry" in LT2:347)
  BERYL, possibly elessar, *elessarn- (see ELF-STONE)
  BESIDE ara, also ar- as prefix. With different prononimal suffixes in VT49:25: (anni >) arni *”beside me”, astyë *”beside you” (intimate sg.), allë *“beside you” (intimate sg.), arsë *”beside him/her”, (anwë >) armë *“beside us” (exclusive), arwë *“beside us” (inclusive), (astë) > ardë *””beside you” (pl.), (astë >) artë *”beside them”, (anwet >) armet *“beside us” (dual exclusive). –AR, VT49:25
  BETWEEN 1) imbi (dual imbë). This is "between" referring to a gap, space, barrier, or anything intervening between two other things, like or unlike one another. The pluralized form imbi implies "among" of several things (ancalima imbi eleni "brightest among stars"); "in the sense 'among' before plurals [imbë] is usually pluralized > imbi even when a plural noun follows". As pointed out by Patrick Wynne, imbi may also be used in the sense of "between" before two singular nouns connected by "and" (as in the example imbi Menel Cemenyë "between heaven and earth"), whereas imbë is used before dual forms, as in the examples imbë siryat "between two rivers", imbë met "between us". Elided imb' is attested in the phrase imb' illi "among all". The form imbit is said to be a "dualized form" expressing "between two things" when "these are not named" (VT47:30), apparently implying that imbit by itself means *"between the two", with no noun following. 2) enel (used for "between" = "at the central position in a row, list, series, etc. but also applied to the case of three persons" [VT47:11]. This preposition refers to the position of a thing between others of the same kind). 3) mitta- (does the final hyphen suggest that the latter form is used as prefix, somewhat like *"inter-"?) –Nam/RGEO:67, VT47:11, 30; VT43:30
  BEYOND pella (a postposition in Quenya: Andúnë pella "beyond the West", elenillor pella "from beyond the stars"). Genuine prepositions meaning “beyond” are han, ava (outside) –Nam, MC:222, VT43:14, VT45:6 
  BIER tulma –LT1:270
  BIG hoa (large), túra (great) (PE17:115). See GREAT, HUGE. Other combinations: BIG BOY see BOY; BIG TOE see TOE; BIG DIPPER see SICKLE OF THE VALAR
  BIND (see TIE); in more abstract sense: avalerya- (make fast, restrain, deprive of liberty) –VT41:5, 6
BIPED #attalya (Only pl Attalyar is attested. The word was used of the Petty-dwarves, q.v.) –WJ:389
  BIRD aiwë, filit (pl filici) (Note: both aiwë and filit are stated to mean "small bird", not "bird" in general), ambalë, ammalë (= yellow bird), lindo (= "singer", singing bird). LT1:273 also has wilin; this may or may not be a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. –AIWĒ, PHILIK, SMAL, LIN   
  BIRTH, BIRTHDAY nosta; GIVE BIRTH nosta- (but in later sources, nosta- is glossed "beget", q.v.) –LT1:272
  BITE (vb) nac- (but in late material, the same verb is said to mean “hew, cut”), BITE (noun) nahta (note: a homophone means "eighteen", though it is not the regular word in decimal counting: neither word must be confused with the verb nahta- “slay”.) –NAK, VT49:24
  BITTER sára –SAG
  BLACK morë (stem mori-, as in compounds like  Moriquendi), morna, morqua; BLACKNESS mórë (darkness, night); BLACKHANDED morimaitë, BLACKBERRY piucca (only glossed "berry" in GL:64); BLACK FOE Moringotto (the oldest [MET] form was Moriñgotho) (Morgoth). BLACK ARTS núlë (sorcery). (The word is spelt “ñúle” in the source, reflecting the older pronunciation; in Tengwar spelling the initial nasal should therefore be represented by the letter Noldo). –MOR, LT1:260, LotR:1015/SD:68, 72, LT2:347, MR:194, PE17:125
  BLADE hyanda (share), (sword blade:) †russë (corruscation) –LT2:342, RUS
  BLAZE (noun:) ruinë (“a fire, a blaze”), (verb:) urya- (The stem this verb is derived from was struck out in Etym. However, several words that must be derived from the same stem occur in LotR, indicating that Tolkien restored it.) BLAZING HOT úrin (Úrin also being a name of the Sun) –PE17:183, UR, LT1:271
  BLEND (noun) ostimë (pl. ostimi is attested). This term refers to a kind of "strengthened" elements within a stem, where a single sound has been expanded into two different elements while maintaining a unitary effect and significance; souch as s- being turned ito st-, or m being strengthened to mb. However, this may be the meaning of the word in linguistic terminology only; it may be permissible to use it for "blend" in more general senses as well. –VT39:9
  BLESS manya- (“sc. either to afford grace or help or to wish it”, VT49:41), laita- (praise) (Imperative a laita and future #laituva are attested, the latter with pronominal endings: laituvalmet, "we shall praise [or bless] them".) The continuative form mánata (*”is blessing”) does according to Carl F. Hostetter imply an aorist stem *manta (VT49:52). The passive participle aistana "blessed" (see below) argues the existence of a verbal stem #aista- "to bless", but this verb seems etymologically connected to airë "holy" and should probably only be used with reference to more or less "divine" persons (aistana refers to the Virgin Mary in the source), who are "blessed" in the sense of having their holiness recognized and respected. 
  BLESSED alya, almárëa (prosperous, rich, abundant), herenya (wealthy, fortunate, rich), manaquenta or manquenta, also aman ("blessed, free from evil" – Aman was "chiefly used as the name of the land where the Valar dwelt" [WJ:399], and as an adjective “blessed” the word may add an adjectival ending: amanya, VT49:41). Aman is the apparent Quenya equivalent of “the Blessed Realm” (allative Amanna is attested, VT49:26). The word calambar, apparently literally *“light-fated”, also seems to mean “blessed” (VT49:41). Cf. also BLESSED BEING Manwë (name of the King of the Valar). Alya, almárëa, and herenya are adjectives that may also have worldly connontations, apparently often used with reference to one who is "blessed" with material possessions or simply has good luck; on the other hand, the forms derived from the root man- primarily describe something free from evil: Cf. mána "blessed" in Fíriel's Song (referring to the Valar) and the alternative form manna in VT43:19 [cf. VT45:32] (in VT45 referring to the Virgin Mary; the form mána may be preferred for clarity, since manna is apparently also the question-word "whither?", "where to?") The forms manaquenta or manquenta also include the man- root, but it is combined with a derivative (passive participle?) of the verbal stem quet- "say, speak", these forms seemingly referring to someone who is "blessed" in the sense that people speak well of this person (a third form from the same source, manque, is possibly incomplete: read manquenta?) (VT44:10-11) The most purely "spiritual" term is possibly the word aistana, used for "blessed" in Tolkien's translation of the Hail Mary, where this word refers to the Virgin (VT43:27-28, 30). Aistana is apparently not an independent adjective (like alya, mána etc.), but rather the passive participle of a verb #aista- "bless"; see above concerning its precise application. BLESSEDNESS vald- (so in LT1:272; nom. sg. must be either *val or *valdë) (happiness; but since this word comes from early material where it was intended to be related to Valar "Happy/Blessed Ones", its conceptual validity may be doubted because Tolkien later reinterpreted Valar as "the Powers" and dropped the earlier etymology). BLESSING (a boon, a good or fortunate thing), see BOON. "BLESSINGS", BLESSEDNESS, BLISS almië, almarë; FINAL BLISS manar, mandë (doom, final end, fate, fortune) –LotR:989 cf Letters:308; GAL, KHER, Letters:283, LT1:272, MAN/MANAD, VT43:19, 27-28, 30
  BLIGHT yaru (gloom) –GL:37
  BLINK tihta- (peer) –MC:223
  BLOCK #tap- (stop). (Cited in the form tapë, 3 pers sg aorist; misreading "tápe" with a long vowel in the Etymologies as printed in LR: see VT46:17). The pa.t. tampë is given. –TAP/VT46:17
  BLOOD sercë (so according to Silm appendix; Etym has yár [yar-]) –Silm:437, YAR
  BLOSSOM (white) lossë, ("of flowers in bunches or clusters":) *lohtë (emended from the actual reading loktë because Tolkien later decided that kt became ht in Quenya.) –LOT, LT1:258
  BLOT motto –MBOTH
  BLUE luinë (pl. luini in Nam; for "blue" Etym and LT1:262 have lúnë; both luinë and lúnë would be expected to have stem-forms in –i- given the primitive form luini, lugni), ninwa, ulban (adopted from Valarin; only used in Vanyarin Quenya), PALE BLUE helwa, BLUISH *luinincë (given in archaic form luininki, so the Quenya word would have the stem-form luininci-)  –VT48:24, Nam/LT2:340, LT1:262, LUG, WJ:399, 3EL, VT48:18, 23
  BOAT luntë; SMALL BOAT venë (vessel, dish) –LUT, LT1:254
  BODY hroa (pl. hroar is attested. In MR:330, Tolkien notes that hroa is "roughly but not exactly equivalent to 'body'" [as opposed to "soul"]. Hroa is also used = "physical matter"), DEAD BODY loico (corpse); BODILY sarcuva (corporeal – this is "Qenya"); BODY-IMPULSE hroafelmë (impulses provided by the body, e.g. physical fear, hunger, thirst, sexual desire) –MR:216, 219; VT39:30/VT47:35, MC:223, LT2:347, VT41:19 cf. 13

  BONE axo (pl axor is attested) –MC:222, 223
  BOOK parma (writings), also attested with suffixes: parmastanna “upon [-nna] your [-sta, dual] book”. BOOK LANGUAGE (=Quenya) parmalambë; *BOOK-FAIR #parma-resta (attested with suffixes: parma-restalyanna *”upon your book-fair”; see FAIR #2 for further discussion). –PAR/UT:219, 460, LT2:346, VT49:39, 47
  BOON: The wod mána is said to mean “any good or fortunate thing, a boon or ‘blessing’, a grace, being esp. used of some thing/person/event that helps or amends an evil or difficulty”). Hence the exclamation yé mána (ma) = “what a blessing, what a good thing!” (VT49:41)
  BORDER réna (edge, margin); ríma (edge, hem) –REG, RĪ
  BORN #nóna (isolated from Apanónar, the "Afterborn") –Silm:122/381
  BORNE colla (pa.p. of col- "bear") (worn). Also used as a noun = "vestment, cloak". –MR:385
  BOSOM palúrë (surface, bosom of earth), súma (hollow cavity) –PAL, MC:223
  BOSS OF SHIELD tolmen (isolated round hill) –LT1:269
  BOTH yúyo (also prefix yú- "twi-"). Yúyo is followed by a “singular” or uninflected noun, as in yúyo má “both hand(s)” –YŪ, VT46:23, VT49:10
  BOUND nauta (obliged) –NUT
  BOTTLE olpë –QL:69
  BOW (vb) luhta- (Note: a homophone means "enchant"), #caw- (cited in source as cawin "I bow", 1st pers. aorist; in Tolkien's later conception it would be difficult to account for w in this position, and we should perhaps read *cav- with pa.t. *canwë); BOW (noun) quinga, cú (also = crescent Moon), lúva, cúnë (crescent); RAINBOW helyanwë ("sky-bridge"), Ilweran, Ilweranta (LT2:348 has iluquinga "sky-bow", but this word was obsoleted when Tolkien changed the meaning of ilu from "sky" to "universe".) BOWLEGGED quingatelco (So it is translated, but this must really be a noun: "bow-leg" [quinga + telco]. No Quenya adjectives end in –o, unless this is the only one. Read *quingatelca for "bow-legged"? Cf. one of the other words from the same source, sincahonda, changed from sincahondo in an earlier draft – but at that time Tolkien had already omitted quingatelco and hence did not change its ending: See SD:72.) –VT47:35, LT1:257, SD 68, 72, KWIG, KU3, LT1:256, LotR:1154, LT1:271
  BOWELS, see ENTRAILS
  BOWL tolpo, salpa, #salpë (isolated from tanyasalpë "Bowl of Fire"), fion (goblet – but this word reappears with the unrelated meaning “hawk” in later material) –PE16:142, LT1:292, 253
  BOX colca –QL:37
  BOY: the word seldo, though not clearly glossed by Tolkien, appears to be the masculine form of a word for "child". BIG BOY yonyo (son; this term is also used for "middle finger" or "middle toe" in children's play). –SEL-D-, VT46:13, VT47:10, 15
  BRANCH *olva (PM:340 actually gives olba, a form that can only occur in the variant of Quenya that uses lb for lv). Etym has olwa, but probably this should also be *olva according to the phonology Tolkien used later (notice that the w of the Etym form is to be derived from older b, since the root is GÓLOB; later Tolkien apparently presupposed that older lb becomes either lv or is preserved as lb in Quenya). TRUNCATED BRANCH, see STUB, STUMP. –PM:340, GÓLOB
  BRAND yulma (Note: a homophone means "cup".) –YUL cf. Nam
  BREAD massa ( masta; LIFE-BREAD (= lembas) coimas (either *coimass- or coimast-, cf. massa, masta "bread"), BREAD-GIVER (fem.) massánië (title of the "Lady" or the highest among the elven-women of any people, she having the right to keep or give away lembas bread). –VT43:18, MBAS, Silm:406/429, PM:404
  BREAK (vb) rac- (past participle rácina "broken" is attested); BREAK APART terhat- (pa.t. terhantë); BREAK ASUNDER hat- (pa.t. hantë) – but in earlier material, hat- meant “fling”, and Tolkien may have restored that meaning (see FLING). Since the status of hat- “break asunder” is uncertain, the alternative form #ascat- (pa.t. ascantë) apparently from the same root may be preferred. –MC:223, SKAT, SD:310
  BREAST (chest) ambos (ambost-). –PE16:82
  BREASTPLATE ambassë (hauberk) –QL:30
  BREATH (noun) hwesta (breeze, puff of air), foa (puff of breath), súlë (Þ) (spirit) (earlier [MET] form thúlë = Þúlë). BREATHE (vb) súya- (Þ); BREATHER Súlimo (Þ) (a title of Manwë; this is the literal meaning according to Silm:420); BREATH FORTH see EXPIRE. –SWES, VT47:35, 36, THŪ/LotR:1157
  BREEZE hwesta (breath, puff of air), GENTLE BREEZE vílë; BREEZY vilin (airy) –SWES, LotR:1157, LT1:273
  BRICK telar –PM13:153
  BRIDE indis (wife) (This word may obsolete akairis in LT1:252.) The stem-form of indis "bride" is somewhat obscure; according to VT45:37 the stem could be indiss- (pl. indissi given), but the alternative form pl. form inderi shows a curious shift from i to e as well as the more regular change from s (via z) to r between vowels. Indiss- may be preferred by writers. –NDIS/UT:8, VT45:37
  BRIDEGROOM ender –NDER (cf. VT45:11 for etymology)
  BRIDGE yanwë (joining, isthmus), yanta (yoke) –YAT, LotR:1157
  BRILLIANCE alcar, alcarë (splendour, radiance), calassë (clarity), ?rillë (reading of manuscript uncertain, see VT46:11), BRILLIANT alcarinqua (glorious) –AKLA-R-/RGEO:73/UT:317/WJ:369/Silm:427, GL:39
  BROAD – LT2:338 gives a word aica "broad, vast", but this is probably obsoleted by aica "sharp, fell, terrible, dire" in later writings. 
  BROAD SWORD lango (also = prow of ship), BROAD-BLADED SWORD ecet (short stabbing sword) –LAG, UT:284/432
  BROKEN rácina –MC:223

  BROOD luvu- (lower) –LT1:259
  BROOK nellë (GL:46 has wentë) –NEN
  BROTHER háno, colloquial hanno (in children's play, hanno is also used = middle finger). A different word for "brother" occurs in the Etymologies: toron (pl. torni) (= natural brother); cf. otorno "sworn brother, associate". BROTHERHOOD onóro (of bloodkinship), otornassë (the latter is evidently the "brotherhood" of otornor, sworn brothers) –VT47:12, 14, TOR, NŌ
  BROWN varnë (stem varni-) (swart, dark brown) –BARÁN
  BUD tuima (sprout); BUDDING see SPRING-TIME. –TUY, LT1:269
  BUFFET taran, tarambo –LT2:337
  BUILD #car- (cited as carin "I make, build", 1st pers. aorist – according to FS and SD:246 the past tense is cárë, but Etym has carnë; writers should probably use the latter form, not to be confused with the adjective carnë "red". The passive participle #carna *"built, made" is attested in Vincarna *"newly-made" in MR:305.) BUILDING car (card-) (house), ampano (= especially building of wood, wooden hall; umpano in VT45:36 sems to be a variant form), ataquë (construction). BUILDER samno (Þ) (carpenter, wright) –KAR, PAN, VT45:36, TAK, STAB
  BULL tarucco, tarunco (see OX) –LT2:347
  BUNCH loxë (cluster). Note: a homophone means "hair". (QL:55). BUNCHES (of flowers), see BLOSSOM.
  BURDEN cólo (VT39:10)
  BURDENSOME lumna (lying heavy, oppressive, ominous). Combined with the superlative prefix an-, this word should appear as *andumna because d was the initial sound of the original root. –DUB
  BURLY polda (strong) –POL
  BURN usta- (transitive, e.g. *Fëanáro usta i ciryar "Fëanor burns the ships"), urya- (intransitive, e.g. *i ciryar uryar "the ships burn/are burning"). The form usta- reflects the stem USU occurring in early material (QL:98), but since Tolkien changed the relevant stem to UR later, we should perhaps read *urta- for usta-. –LT1:271, QL:98, cf. the original entry UR "be hot" in Etym 
  BURST (passive participle) rúvina. A verb #ruv- “to burst” may be extrapolated; the root is given as RUVU “burst asunder” –QL:81 
  BUSH tussa –TUS
  BUT: A sting of different words for the conjunction "but" are attested. In the Etymologies, the word for "but" is ná or nán. In Fíriel's Song, the short variant nan appears. One text (VT49:15) uses apa for “but”, but elsewhere, this is a preposition “after”. In Tolkien's drafts for a Quenya version of the Lord's Prayer, he was experimenting with many words for "but": anat, onë, ono (VT43:23; ono occurs also in another text in VT44:5/9, and shorter nó is attested in VT41:13), but in the final version of the Lord's Prayer, he used mal. We cannot know how many of these alternatives Tolkien would have considered conceptually valid and which were just experimental. For the purpose of writing in Quenya, the variant ná is probably best avoided since it can be confused with the copula "is"; likewise, nán (and nan?) may also mean *"I am" (ná, na- + the pronominal ending -n "I"). The Lord's Prayer variants are less ambiguous, and mal (the word used in the final version) is perhaps the best alternative so far published. BUT meaning "only" (as in "I am but a boy") may be rendered by er (only, one, alone, still). BUT YET a-nanta, ananta (and yet) –NDAN, LT1:269, FS, VT41:13, VT43:23
  BUTTERFLY wilwarin (wilwarind-) –WIL/MC:222, 223/LT1:273
  BUTTOCKS hacca (hams) –GL:47
  BY as a prep. introducing the agent in a passive construction may be rendered by ló (nahtana ló Turin *“slain by Túrin”, VT42:24) or by the instrumental case (turún’ ambartanen “by doom mastered”, UT:138). BY meaning “near; next to” may be rendered by ara “beside” (*coa ara ëar, “a house by the sea”). BY THIS MEANS, see SO.
 –BY-mas (final element in place-names, see –TON) –LT1:250

  CAPE mundo (nose, snout), stem *mundu- given the primitive form mbundu. (Note: mundo also means "ox", and as such the word may not have a distinct stem-form.) CAPE (OF LAND) nortil (stem *nortill-), said to be "only used of the ends of promontories or other seaward projections that were relatively sharp and spike-like". –MBUD, VT47:28
  CAPTAIN hesto –VT45:22

  CARRIER (the sign used to "carry" short vowel-symbols in the Tengwar system) anar (the word for "sun", which would require an initial vowel-carrier in the Tengwar mode used for Quenya) –VT45:6 
  CARRY – GL:38 has yulu-, but in WJ:416 the same stem (there spelt JULU) is said to mean "drink", indicating that yulu- "carry" had probably been abandoned in Tolkien's later Quenya. Use rather #col-; see BEAR.
  CART norollë –GL:31
 ?CASSIOPEIA Wilwarin (the identification of this constellation is not certain. Wilwarin means "butterfly".) –Silm:426
  CASTLE OF CUSTODY – this is mentioned as the approximate meaning of Mandos (stem Mandost-) –MR:350

  CELEBRIMBOR (= "Silver-fist") Telperinquar (possibly *Telperinquár-. Cf. quárë "fist"). –Silm:429
  CELEBRINDAL ("Silver-foot", Idril's epithet) Taltyelemna ("Taltelemna" in the printed Etymologies is a misreading, see VT45:25) Tolkien apparently abandoned the form Taltelepsa. –KYELEP
  CELEGORM Turcafinwë, short form Turco (not equivalent in sense to his Sindarin name, which is a cognate of his mother-name [q.v.] Tyelcormo "hasty-riser"; the latter name was "never used in narrative".) –PM:352, 353
  CELOS Celussë (see UT:426)
  CENTRE endë (core, middle). (The form endë is probably to be preferred to entë in one late source.) Early material also has tólë. –NÉD, ÉNED, VT41:16, LT1:269
  CENTURY haranyë (or perhaps it means the last day of a century – Tolkien's wording is not clear. The latter interpretation may be more likely.) –LotR:1142
  CHAIN (noun) limil . Also proper name Angainor (= "The Great Chain" with which Morgoth was twice bound; LT1:249 has the form Angaino) –QL:54, Silm:59

 CHEESE tyur (tyurd-) (QL:50; tyuru- in GL:28 is actually a verb "to 'turn' milk"; cf. QL:50.)
  CHERRY pio (this word was also applied to plums). CHERRY TREE aipio (also used = "plum tree"???) –LT2:347, GL:18
  CHIEF (adj) héra (principal); CHIEF (noun) #turco (isolated from Turcomund "chief of bulls, *chief bull"; this may not be pure Quenya, but Turco appears as a the short name of Turcafinwë, Celegorm's Quenya name – though that is translated "strong, powerful (in body)" rather than referring to more "political" power) –KHER, Letters:423, PM:352
  CHIEFTAIN (or CHIEF, VT45:17) haran (stem harn-, as in pl harni) (in Etym also = king, but in LotR and other texts the Quenya word for "king" is aran pl. arani – see KING), cáno, cánu (see COMMANDER) (ruler, governor, commander) –3AR, UT:400
  CHILD hína, also vocative hina with a short vowel, used when addressing a (young) child. Pl. híni rather than ?hínar; see CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR below. CHILD NOT YET FULLY GROWN, see BABY. "Child" as the last element in compounds: -hin (-hín-, pl. -híni), e.g. CHILDREN OF ERU Eruhíni from sg. #Eruhin; CHILDREN OF ILÚVATAR Híni Ilúvataro; MY CHILD hinya (short for hinanya, used as a vocative only). (For "child", Etym also has seldë; Tolkien changed the meaning from "daughter". Possibly, seldë is meant to have the meaning "female child", hence "girl". Selda was apparently introduced as a gender-neutral word for "child".) The word onna, elsewhere defined as “creature” and etymologically meaning *”something” begotten, is used for “child” in one late text (onnalya/onnalda “your [sg. and pl.] child”, VT49:41). –WJ:403, Silm:387/432, VT44:35, SEL-D-/VT46:13, VT49:41

  CHOKE quoro- (suffocate), CHOKED quorin (drowned). Verbs in –o seem not to occur in later Quenya; read *quor-? It has also been questioned whether the combination quo- is still possible in Tolkien's later Quenya. –LT1:264
  CHOOSING #cilmë (isolated from Essecilmë "name-choosing", q.v.) –MR:214
  CHRIST Hristo (variant Hrísto with a long vowel, though long vowels in front of consonant clusters do not normally occur in Quenya). Another form, apparently an attempt at translating this title rather than merely adapting to Quenya phonology the word "Christ", was Elpino of uncertain etymology. However, Tolkien may have abandoned this form. –VT44:15-16, 18
  CHRONOLOGICAL ACCOUNT lúmequenta (history). The unglossed term lumenyárë appears to mean *"chronological story". –LU, NAR2

Calaciryo in Namárië] – though this clashes with cirya "ship". An early version of Namárië actually had Calacilyo, not Calaciryo; see An Introduction to Elvish p. 5.) –YAG/VT46:22, STAK, SYAD, RGEO:70/WJ:403, LT2:337, 341, KIL

  CLOAK colla (vestment, actually a past participle "borne, worn" used as a noun). GREY-CLOAK Sindacollo, Singollo (so in Silm:421; MR:217 has Sindicollo. Note that colla has become #collo because –o is a masculine ending.) (Thingol). Verb "to cloak": fanta- (to veil, mantle) –MR:385, VT43:22

  CLOUD fanya (white cloud; pl. fanyar is attested), lumbo (pl lumbor is attested. In LT1:259, it is stated that this word applies to a "dark lowering cloud"), ungo (dark shadow). (In ancient times the Elves probably also used the word fana [in Etym fána] for "cloud" or "veil", but in Quenya it came to denote the visible bodies in which the Valar manifested themselves to incarnates. When fana no longer meant "cloud", this meaning was evidently transferred to the derivative fanya, originally probably meaning "white" or as noun "white thing".) UPPER AIRS AND CLOUDS fanyarë (skies) –SPAN/VT46:15, MC:222, UÑG, Nam, RGEO:67, SYAD, RGEO:74, MC:223

COLD (noun?) niquë, also vb niquë- "it is cold, it freezes"; COLD POOL OR LAKE (in mountains) ringwë (in the Etymologies as printed in LR, this word is cited as "ringe", but according to VT46:11, ringwë is the proper reading),  BE COLD, CHILL (of weather) nicu- –MC:222, RINGI/VT46:11, LT1:260, WJ:417

  COME #tul- (cited in source as tulin "I come", 1st pers. aorist); perfect #utúlië and future #tuluva are attested (the latter with the prefix entuluva "shall come again". Tulin may obsolete tulu- in LT1:270). COME AWAY hótuli- ("so as to leave a place or group and join another in the thought or place of the speaker") –TUL, LotR:1003, Silm:229, WJ:368

  COMMAND (verb) *can- (so when used of persons; when used with things as object, this verb means demand) –PM:361-362 (where the stem KAN is mentioned; the Quenya verb is not directly cited as such, but seems implied by Tolkien's discussion of how this stem was used in Quenya.) For “command” as a noun, see ORDER.

  CONCEAL halya- (veil, screen from light). In early "Qenya" there is also the word fur- (read perhaps *hur-), also translated "to lie". –SKAL, LT2:340
  CONCEALED furin or hurin (hidden). According to Tolkien’s post-LotR ideas, the form in hu- would be preferred in late Quenya. –LT2:340

  CONSOLE tiuta- (comfort) –QL:93
  CONSONANT #pataca (only pl. patacar is attested), #lambetengwë (literally "tongue-sign"; only pl. lambetengwi is attested; this refers to consonants as tengwi or phonemes), also náva-tengwë ("ñava-") (literally "mouth-sign"; only pl. náva-tengwi is attested; the shorter form #návëa pl. návëar was also used, but Fëanor replaced these terms with #pataca). Yet another term for "consonant" was #tapta tengwë "impeded element". (Only pl. tapta tengwi is attested; we would rather expect *taptë tengwi with the pl. form of the adjective. The nominal pl. of the adjective, taptar, was used in the same sense as tapta tengwi.) Tolkien also notes: "Since...in the mode of spelling commonly used the full signs were consonantal, in ordinary non-technical use tengwar [sg tengwa, see LETTER] became equivalent to 'consonants'." Cf. also surya "spirant consonant" and punta "stopped consonant", i.e. a consonant sign with an underposed dot to indiate that it is not followed by a vowel. –VT39:8, VT39:16, 17, WJ:396, SUS, PUT (see PUS), VT46:10, 33

  COOKED FOOD apsa (meat) –AP 
  COPING-STONE see FINISH.
  COPPER urus (urust-), cf. POLISHED COPPER calarus (calarust-). In the Etymologies, the word rauta was originally defined "copper", but Tolkien changed the definition to "metal" in general. The earliers material has COPPER = tambë; OF COPPER tambina. Etym has COPPER-COLOURED aira (ruddy, red) –VT41:10, RAUTĀ, LT1:250, 256, 268, GAY
  CORE endë (centre, middle). –NÉD, ÉNED

  CORRUSCATION russë (†swordblade) –RUS
  COTTAGE – LT2:336 has os(t) "house and cottage", but this word is probably obsolete – osto means "city" or "fortress" in Tolkien's later Quenya. 
  COUNT – the stem not- can be isolated from the word for "countable", see below. It actually occurs in Etym, but is glossed "reckon" instead. COUNT UP onot- (cf. not- "reckon" – the perfect of both these verbs would presumably be *onótië), COUNTABLE #nótima (isolated from únótimë "countless, not-countable, numberless", sg. únótima). NOT COUNTING hequa (leaving aside, excluding, except) –NOT, Nam, RGEO:67, VT39:14, WJ:364, 365

  CREST (of wave) wingë (wingi-) (foam, spindrift). LT1:256 gives ormë "crest, summit", but in Tolkien's later Quenya ormë means "wrath, haste, violence, rushing". CRESTED WAVE, WAVE-CREST falma –WIG/LT1:273, PHAL, VT42:15

  CRUEL nwalca (Though spelt this way also in Etym, nwalca must be from older *ngwalca, for the stem is ÑGWAL. In Tengwar spelling, the letter nwalmë (< older ngwalmë) should be used to transcribe the initial nw of nwalca.) –ÑGWAL

  CRY OF TRIUMPH (noun) yello (call, shout) –GYEL, VT45:16
  CRYSTAL maril (glass – perhaps with stem marill-), CRYSTAL SUBSTANCE silima (a substance Fëanor alone knew how to make; the Silmarils were made of it. Etymologically, the word apparently means simply *"white-shining thing", or perhaps *"[substance] apt to shine white".) –VT46:13, RGEO:73, Silm:437
  CUNNING – LT1:253 has findë, finië, but these words may not be valid in Tolkien's later Quenya (in Etym, findë means "tress, lock of hair").
  CUP yulma (pl. yulmar is attested, VT21:6, 10; VT48:11). –Nam, RGEO:67
  CUPOLA coromindo (dome), telluma (altered from earlier telumë under influence of a Valarin word; pl. tellumar is attested) –Nam/WJ:399/411, KOR, KOP
  CURSE (vb.) húta-, pa.t. huntë or huntanë. CURSED húna (accursed). –PE17:149
  CURUFIN Curufinwë, short form Curvo. (His "mother-name", never used in narrative, was Atarincë.) –PM:352, 353
  CURUNÍR Curumo (Saruman) –UT:393, 401
  CURVED cúna (bent; cúna is also used as a verbal stem, see BEND) –MC:223
  CUSHION nirwa –NID
  CUSTODY mando (safe keeping); CASTLE OF CUSTODY Mandos (Mandost-) –MR:350
  CUT (vb) rista-; venië (infinitive? stem #ven-?) (shape), CUT (noun) rista, venwë (shape). The verb nac- is defined as “hew, cut” in late material (nacin, VT49:24), though in Etym, it was assigned the meaning “bite” instead (NAK). CUT OFF (and get rid of or lose a portion:) #aucir-, (so as to have or or use a required portion:) #hócir- (Tolkien cited these verbs with what seems to be the ending -i of the aorist: auciri-, hóciri-). –RIS, LT1:254, WJ:365-366, 368
  CYCLE randa (age) –RAD

  <D>
  DAERON see DAIRON
  DADDY (affectionate form of "father"): atto, atya (these words are also used in children's play for "thumb" or "big toe"). The form tatanya in UT:191 seems to mean *"my daddy". –ATA, VT47:10, 26, VT48:4; atya is a reduced form of atanya "my father". 
  DAGGER sicil (knife), naica –SIK, GL:37
  DAILY ilaurëa (another form, ilyarëa [read *ilyárëa?] and its archaic variant ilyázëa, was apparently abandoned by Tolkien) –VT43:18
  DAINTY netya (pretty). (Note: netya- is also a verb "trim, adorn".) –VT47:33
  DAIRON Sairon –GL:29 (called Daeron in the published Silmarillion)
  DALE nal, nallë (dell); DALE-SPRITES tavar (pl. tavarni). In Tolkien's later Quenya, tavar means "wood" (as material). See, however, DRYAD. –LT1:261, LT1:267
  DAMP ringa (chilly, cold) –LT1:265
  DANCE (verb) lilta- –LILT
  DANGER #raxë (pl. ablative raxellor attested). In another version of the text in question, Tolkien used #raxalë (pl. abl. raxalellor) instead. –VT44:9
  DANGLE linga- (hang) –LING
  DARE verya- (cf. BOLD) (see MARRY regarding a homophone) –BER
  DARK (adj.) morna (gloomy, sombre, black), nulla (dusky, obscure), lóna (Note: a homophone means "island"), lúrëa (overcast), DARK OR HIDDEN tumna (low-lying, low, profound, deep). DARK (noun) hui (fog, murk, night); DARK, DARKNESS mornië, mórë (blackness, night) mor, lúmë (Note: lúmë also means "hour, time"), lómë (stem lómi-) (night, twilight, gloom), huinë (shadow, gloom). (See SLAYER for DARKNESS-SLAYER.) DARK ELVES Moriquendi, Morimor (Lómëarni in LT1:259 is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya); DARK ONE (=Morgoth) morion; DARK WEATHER lúrë; DARK LOWERING CLOUD lumbo (pl. lumbor is attested); DARK VALE tumbo (stem *tumbu-) (deep valley) –Letters:382, NDUL, DO3, LT1:259, LT1:271, LT1:253, MOR, LotR:488 cf. Letters:308, Silm:431, MC:222 cf. 215, WJ:361/Silm:388, Nam/RGEO:67, FS, LT1:259, 269
  DAUGHTER selyë; also yendë, yen, –iel (suffix, e.g. Uinéniel "daughter of Uinen" [UT:182]; this suffix may obsolete the earlier [TLT] ending -wen, mentioned in LT1:271). The stem YEL, from which –iel must be derived, was removed from Etym. However, the UT example just mentioned is from a later text, indicating that Tolkien restored –iel. Perhaps yeldë was restored as the independent word for "daughter" at the same time and is to be preferred to yendë, yen. Distinguish -riel in Altáriel (Galadriel), which does not mean "daughter" and becomes -riell- before an ending. –VT47:10, YŌ, YEL, 182/469
  DAWN ára (obsoleting órë in LT1:264; this word means "rising" or "heart" in LotR-style Quenya), †amaurëa (early day). See also TWILIGHT. –AR1, MC:223
  DAY aurë (sunlight; Etym gives arë, ari- instead). The word aurë is defined as “a day (of light), a day of special meaning or festival”; allative aurenna “upon the day” (VT49:45). Cf. also: arya (= 12 daylight hours; notice however that the word arya is assigned other meanings in late material), ré (= 24 hours, counted from sunset to sunset, allative rénna in VT49:45), sana (= also 24 hours, but this “Qenya” term clashes with a later demonstrative “that”), DAYTIME arië, EARLY DAY †amaurëa (dawn), DAYLIGHT: LT1:254 gives calma, but this word is defined "lamp" in LotR. LAST DAY OF YEAR quantien, FIRST DAY (meaning obscure, possibly first day of year) minyen. (In the entry YEN of the Etymologies as printed in LR, minyen is seemingly glossed both "first day" and "first year", but according to VT46:23, only "first day" is correct.) DAYSPRING tuilë –AR1/VT45:6, Silm:229/234/439, LotR:1141, LT1:250, MC:223, YEN
  DEAD firin (= dead by natural cause), qualin (related to qualmë "agony, death" and probably has darker connotations than firin), vanwa (departed, lost, past, gone, vanished, no longer to be had), hessa (withered). DEAD BODY loico (corpse) –KWAL, PHIR, MC:223, LT1:255, WJ:366
  DEAL WITH mahta- (fight, handle, manage, wield, wield a weapon); pa.t. mahtanë is attested. –MAK/VT39:11, VT47:6, 18, 19, VT49:10
  DEAR melda (beloved), melin, moina (familiar), #melya (isolated from Melyanna "dear gift", Melian's Quenya name), valda (worth, worthy). Cf. also the "suffix of endearment" -ya mentioned in UT:418: Anardilya *"dear Anardil" (UT:174). DEAR KINSMAN (form of address) tyenya (literally “my thou”, with tye as an intimate 2nd person pronoun reserved for relatives and close friends). –MEL, MOY, Silm:434, GL:23, VT49:51
  DEATH qualmë, unqualë (agony; according to VT45:24, Tolkien changed this word to anqualë), #fírië, #effírië (basically "expiration", attested with the ending -mmo in fíriemmo, effíriemmo "of our death"), nuru, older ñuru (personalized Nuru = Mandos), fairë (natural death [as act]) (Note: fairë also means "radiance" and "phantom", and even [in LT1:250] "free"), urdu –KWAL/LT1:264, VT43:34, ÑGUR/VT46:4, PHIR, LT2:342
  DEBT #rohta (attested in pl. form rohtar). Used in draft version of Tolkien's Quenya Lord's prayer, this word may refer to moral rather than financial "debt"; it may also cover "trespass". This is probably also true of variant words for "debt" occurring in other versions: #lucassë, #lucië, #luhta (all are attested with the ending -mmar to express "our debts/trespasses"). –VT43:19
  DEBTOR #rocindo, #rucindo (isolated from rocindollomman, rucindollomman "from our debtors"). Used in one of the draft versions of Tolkien's Quenya version of the Lord's Prayer, the "debtors" denoted by this word may be sinners rather than simply people owing others money. Another version of the Prayer has #lucando or #lucindo as the word for "debtor" or "one who trespasses" (attested in the plural: lucandor, lucindor). –VT43:20
  DECISION, see CONSIDERING A MATTER (with a view to decision)
  DECIMAL SYSTEM (in counting) maquanotië. Another source gives a word for "decimal system" as caistanótië, incorporating caista "10th", but since Tolkien later decided that the initial sound of words having to do with "10" should be qu- rather than c-, we must apparently read *quaistanótië. But maquanótië (a form requiring no changes) may be preferred. –VT47:10, VT48:11
  DEED carda –PE17:51
  DECLIVITY pendë (downslape, slope) –PEN
  DEEP núra, tumna (low-lying, low, profound, dark or hidden). DEEP POOL lón, lónë (pl. lóni given) (river-[?feeding] well), DEEP VALLEY tumbo (dark vale); DEEP VALE imbë (dell) (Note: imbë is also one form of the preposition "between"); DEEP SHADOW huinë (gloom). –NŪ, TUB, VT48:28, VT45:18, VT41:8
  DEFORMED CREATURE ulundo (hideous creature, monster) –ÚLUG
  DELIVER (= *save) etelehta- (the alternative verb etrúna-, eterúna- was possibly abandoned by Tolkien; see FREE [verb]). –VT43:23, VT44:9
  DELL imbë (deep vale) (Note: imbë is also the preposition "between"), nal, nallë (dale) –VT45:18, LT1:261
  DEMAND can- (so when used with things as object, in effect = ask for; otherwise command, order) –PM:361-362 (where only a stem KAN is mentioned)
  DEMON rauco (pl. #raucar, isolated from Valaraukar (Valaraucar) "Balrogs". LT1:250 gives araukë; WJ:415 has rauco and arauco, defined as "a powerful, hostile, and terrible creature".) See also ORC. –RUK, Silm:436, WJ:415 
  DENTAL SERIES tincotéma (t-series) –LotR:1154
  DENY lala- –LA (Note: a homophone means "laugh", but the past tense forms may differ. See LAUGH.)
  DEPART #av- (cited in the form avin "he departs", read "I depart" in LotR-style Quenya), pa.t. ambë. Also vanya- (pa.t. vannë). (The latter verb Tolkien may have been abandoned in favour of auta-; see PASS.) Lendë pa.t. of lelya/lenna "go" is also glossed as "departed". DEPARTED (adj) vanwa (gone, vanished, lost, past, no longer to be had, dead) –QL:33, WAN, LED cf. VT45:27, WJ:366, Nam
  DEPRIVE OF LIBERTY avalerya- (bind, make fast, restrain) –VT41:5, 6
  DEPRIVED #racina (only pl. racinë is attested) (stripped); DEPRIVED OF úna (destitute, forlorn); DEPRIVED SIGN #racina tengwë (only pl. racinë tengwi is attested). Also translated "stripped sign", this was in early Elvish analysis of Quenya the term for a consonant with no following vowel; the vowel was held to have disappeared or been omitted. –VT39:16, 14
  DESCENDANT indyo (grandchild) (Indyo looks like Vanyarin Quenya; the combination ndy became ny in Noldorin Quenya. The Noldor likely used the form *inyo.) MALE DESCENDANT yondo (son) (In LT2:344, it is said that yondo usually meant "(great) grandson", but in LotR-style Quenya it simply means "son".) –ÑGYO(N)
  DESERT erumë (cf. Eruman a desert north-east of Valinor, though Eruman is used in an entirely different way elsewhere; see HEAVENS.) –ERE
  DESERTED erda (solitary) –LT1:269
  DESIRE (vb) #mer- (cited in the form merë, evidently the 3rd person aorist; pa.t. given as mernë) (want, wish). The stem YES yields a word yesta- "desire" (which may however be confused with yesta “beginning”). DESIRE (noun) írë, náma (= "a desire" or "a judgement"), námië (= "a (single) desire" or "a (single) judgement"), milmë (greed). (Note: írë also means "when".) See SEXUAL DESIRE for a term that possibly has this meaning. DESIREABLE írima (loveable), DESIRER Irmo (name of a Vala). DESIRING TO START mína (eager to go), also verb DESIRE TO GO IN SOME DIRECTION mína- (to wish to go to a place, make for it, have some end in view). –MER, ID, VT41:13, MIL-IK, YES/VT46:23, WJ:403, VT39:11
  DESPISE #nattir- –VT44:8
  DESTINE martya-; DESTINY maranwë –MBARAT
  DESTITUTE úna (deprived of, forlorn); DESTITUTE OF ú (usually followed by genitive: ú calo *"destitute of light [cala]") (without). –VT39:14
  DETERMINANT VOWEL sundóma (lit. *"base-vowel, root-vowel". Christopher Tolkien notes: "Very briefly indeed, the Quendian consonantal base or sundo was characterized by a 'determinant vowel' or sundóma: thus the sundo KAT has a medial sundóma 'A', and TALAT has the sundóma repeated. In derivative forms the sundóma might be placed before the first consonant, e.g. ATALAT.") –WJ:319
  DEVICE tanwë (craft, thing made, construction); SKILLFUL [?DEVICE – Tolkien's handwriting was illegible] curo (curu-) –TAN, VT41:10
  DEVISE auta- (originate, invent) –GAWA
  DEW rossë (fine rain, spray), rin. DEWY nítë (stem *níti-) (moist) –ROS/Letters:282, LT1:265, NEI
  DEXTER forya (right), DEXTEROUS formaitë (right-handed) –VT46:10, PHOR
  DIACRITIC tehta (mark [in writing], sign) (In LotR:1155, the word is applied to the supralinear vowel-marks of Fëanorian writing, and pl. tehtar is attested.) –TEK, LotR:1155
  DIALECT – Tolkien notes that the word lambë "tongue" was originally "nearer to our 'dialect' than to 'language', but later when the Eldar became aware of other tongues, not intelligible without study, lambe naturally became applied to the separate languages of any people or region" (WJ:394). Thus, lambë can hardly be used for "dialect" in Exilic Quenya. Cf. also VT39:15, where lambë is said to mean "the language or dialect of a particular or people".
  DICTUM eques (pl. equessi) (proverbial dictum, quotation, saying) –WJ:392
  DIE fir- (fade) –MC:223, VT43:34
  DIFFICULT hranga (hard; stiff, awkward). Note: hranga- is also a verb “thwart”. –PE17:154, 185
  DIG sapa- or sap-, pa.t. sampë –PE16:145
  DIGIT: For a common term for "finger" and "toe", see TIP.
  DIPHTHONG ocamna; in the source providing this word Tolkien rejected his earlier form osamnar (pl.); compare the Etymologies form #samna (only pl samnar is attested. Distinct in Tengwar spelling from samna "wooden post", that is spelt with initial súlë instead of silmë). Another word for "dipthong" is given as ohlon (pl. ohloni is attested); the latter term was used of vocalic diphthongs and "consonantal diphthongs" (like mb) alike. –VT44:13, 14, SAM, VT39:9, VT48:29
  DIM TO SEE néca (vague, faint) (Pl nécë is attested) –MC:223, 222
  DIMNESS mordo (shadow, obscurity, stain, smear) –VT45:35, MOR
  DIRECT TOWARD (or “be directed toward”) tenta, pa.t. tentanë (perhaps in the sense “directed toward”, transitive, attested in the phrase tentanë numenna “pointed westward”), also tenantë (perhaps in the sense “was directed toward”, intransitive). Used transitively, the verb can also mean “go forth towards” (with the thing approached as direct object). –VT49:23
  DIRE aica (fell, terrible, sharp) –PM:347
  DIRECTION tië (course, line, pathway, road); DESIRE TO GO IN SOME DIRECTION mína- (to wish to go to a place, make for it, have some end in view). – TE3/RGEO:67, VT39:11
  DIRTY vára (soiled) –WA3
  DISAPPEAR vanya- (pa.t. vannë. Note: a homophone of vanya means "beautiful") (go, depart) –WAN
  DISCOLOURED púrëa (smeared) –MC:223
  DISEMBODIED SPIRIT see SPIRIT 
  DISGUST – feel disgust at feuya- (abhor). –PHEW/VT46:9
  DISGUSTING, cf. LOATHSOME
  DISH venë (small boat, vessel) –LT1:254
  DISORDERED rúcina (confused, shattered) –MC:223
  DISPLAY (verb) apanta- (pa.t. apantanë, apantë) (reveal), (noun) apantië –QL:34
  DISTRIBUTE IN EVEN PORTIONS etsat-, estat- (cited without a final hyphen in the source, but this would seem to be a verb, and presumably Quenya). –VT48:11
  DIVIDE IN MIDDLE perya- (halve) (After perya-, a word perina is mentioned; it is undefined but must be the corresponding past participle: *"divided in middle, halved".) –PER
  DIVINE valaina (= "of or belonging to the Valar", probably not to be used with reference to the One who is above them), Eruva (adj. referring to the divinity of Eru himself), DIVINITY valassë –BAL, VT44:18
  DIVISION asta (part, especially one of other equal parts; asta is often used = "month" as a division of the year). –VT48:11
  DO #car- (make, build; see MAKE for various attested forms of this verb); NOT DO #um- (cited in the form umin "I do not", 1st pers. aorist; also short uin) (pa.t. úmë, not to be confused with a noun meaning "collection, crowd"). This verb is also used = "not be", see BE concerning this and other verbs for “not do, not be”. DO NOT! (imperative) vá! (also = I will not); DON'T áva, avá, alalyë (the last form incorporates the ending -lyë "thou", hence "do not thou [do something]"). DON'T DO IT! áva carë! SET VIGOROUSLY OUT TO DO horya- (be compelled to do something, have an impulse)  DO BACK ahtar- or accar- (react; requite, avenge) –KAR, UGU/UMU, WJ:371, VT44:8, VT45:22, PE17:166
  DOER tyaro (actor, agent) –KYAR
  DOG huo, roa –KHUG, VT47:35
  DOME telluma (pl. tellumar is attested) (cupola), coromindo (cupola) –Nam/WJ:399, KOR
  DON'T áva, avá; DON'T DO IT! áva carë! –WJ:371
  DOOM manar, mandë (final end, fate, fortune, final bliss); umbar- (umbart-) (fate). See below concerning *anan in Rithil-Anamo. In the story of Túrin Turambar, it seems that ambar means "doom": Turambar is said to mean "Master of Doom", and Nienor even uses the word in the instrumental case: ambartanen "by doom". Similarly, LT2:348 gives ambar "Fate". But in Etym, ambar means "earth", and LotR Appendix E confirms that "fate" is umbar. DOOM RING Máhanaxar (a foreign word in Quenya, adopted and adapted from Valarin, also translated as:) Rithil-Anamo "Ring of Doom", name of the place where judgement was passed in Valinor (hence Anamo as genitive "of Doom", nominative probably *anan with stem anam-, otherwise but less likely *anama – this seems to be "doom" in the sense of judgement or juridical justice, since the root is NAM as in nam- "to judge"). –MAN/MANAD, MBARAT/VT45:5, Silm:261, 269, LotR:1157, WJ:399, WJ:401
  DOOR, see GATE; *DOOR OF NIGHT: the translation Ando Lómen is given in VT45:28 (citing a deleted entry in the Etymologies). Since Tolkien later decided that the genitive ending should be -o rather than -n, and moreover equipped lómë "night" with the stem-form lómi-, we should perhaps read *Ando Lómio.
  DORIATH #Lestanórë (only gen. Lestanórëo is attested) –WJ:369
  DORLÓMIN Lóminórë –WJ:145
  DOT pica (small spot), tixë (tiny mark, point), amatixë (point over the line of writing; variant amatexë in VT46:19), unutixë (point under the line of writing; the initial element unu- was misread as "nun-" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, see VT46:19) –PIK, TIK/VT46:19
  DOUBLE (prob. adj) atwa, tanta; DOUBLE (vb) tatya- (repeat). (Note: tatya also means "second".) –AT(AT), TATA

  DOWN undu (under, beneath); DOWN-FALL atalantë, atalantië (collapse); DOWN-FALLEN atalantëa (pl atalantië is attested) (ruinous); DOWN BELOW (adv.) nún (underneath); "DOWN-LICK" (i.e., cover completely)  #undulav- (only pa.t. undulávë is attested) –UNU, NŪ, MC:222, 223/Letters:347, RGEO:67/Nam

Urulóci is attested in Silm:138, there capitalized; surprisingly, Urulóci is used as a singular form in Silm:255); SPARK-DRAGON fëalócë; FISH-DRAGON lingwilócë (sea-serpent) –LOK; cf. ANGWA, LT2:341, RAM, UR, PHAY, LIW
  DRAKE (LT2:340) see DRAGON 
  DRAUGHT #yulda (only pl. yuldar is attested), suhto –Nam, SUK
  DRAW #tuc- (cited as tucin "I draw", 1st pers. aorist), saca- (pull – but a homophone means "search"), DRAW WATER calpa- (bale out, scoop out); DRAWING #halmë (isolated from Turuhalmë "Log-drawing", q.v.); DRAW NEAR: see IMPEND concerning Tolkien’s translation of  “winter has drawn near”. –TUK, KALPA, VT43:23, LotR:270
  DREAD (verb) aista- –GAYAS
  DREAM (noun) olor, olórë, lor; DREAM or VISION olos (olor- for older oloz-, as in the archaic pl. olozi, later olori). DREAMY olosta, olórëa –LOS, LT1:259, LotR:488 cf. Letters:308, UT:396
  DREAM (verb) óla- (said to be "impersonal", probably meaning that the dreamer is mentioned in the dative rather than the nominative: *Óla i Eldan, "the Elf dreams") –UT:396
  DRESSED LEATHER alu –QL:30
  DRINK (vb) #suc- (cited in source as sucin "I drink", 1st pers. aorist); DRINK OF THE VALAR limpë (so glossed under LIP; "drink of the fairies" in LT1:258) or míruvórë (LT1:261); DRINKING yulmë (carousal) (Note: a homophone means "smouldering heat"); DRINKING-VESSEL yulma (cup), sungwa. –SUK, WJ:416/Nam

  DÚNEDAIN Núnatani –WJ:386
  DUSK histë (also hísë, but this clashes with a word meaning "fog, mist"), lómë (stem lómi-) (night, gloom, darkness, twilight) –LT1:255
  DUSKY nulla (dark, obscure) –NDUL 
  DUST asto –ÁS-AT
  DWARF Nauco (pl. Naucor is attested; LT1:261 gives nauca instead of nauco), Norno (Naucalië, Nornalië = the whole people of the Dwarves) Casar (pl. Casari or Casári; partitive plural Casalli; the whole people of the Dwarves being called Casallië. According to WJ, Casar – Quenyaized form of Dwarvish Khazâd – "was the word most commonly used in Quenya for the Dwarves". Nauco "stunted one" and norno "thrawn one" are less polite words for "dwarf"; yet norno is stated to be "the more friendly term". But the Dwarves themselves would definitely prefer Casar.) PETTY-DWARVES Picinaucor, Pitya-naucor (lit. *"small dwarves"), Attalyar (lit. "Bipeds"). DWARROWVAULT Casarrondo (Khazad-dûm) –NAUK, WJ:388, 389
  DWELLER mardo –LT1:251
  DWELLING (noun) mar (mard-) (home), also már; DWELLING (adj) #farnë (a pl form? Sg farna? Only attested in the compound orofarnë "mountain-dwelling". Note: farnë is also the pa.t. of farya- "suffice", as well as a noun "foliage"); DWELLING-PLACE nórë (land, region where certain people live, nation, native land, family); DWELLING UNDERGROUND hróta (artificial cave, rockhewn hall). The word ambar, usually translated "world", is also associated with "home, dwelling" in one source. –VT45:33, 46:13, cf. LT1:251, LotR:505 cf. Letters:224, VT47:6, NDOR, PM:365, VT46:13
  DWINDLE píca- (part. pícala is attested) (lessen) –MC:223, 222

  EAGER TO GO mína- (desiring to start) –VT39:11
  EAGLE soron, sornë (Þ) (pl. sorni) (So in Etym; Letters:427 has sorno, thorno, LT1:266 also has sor. Soron/sorno  obsoletes ea, earen in LT1:251 and LT2:338 – besides, ëa means "is, exists" in Tolkien's later Quenya.) KING OF EAGLES Sorontur, "EAGLE-HORN" (a great height in Númenor) Sorontil –THOR, Letters:427, UT:465
  EAR: The form lár in the entry LAS2 in the Etymologies appears to mean "ear", though the wording is not quite clear.
  EARLY arinya; EARLY DAY †amaurëa (dawn); EARLY MORN tuilë (dayspring, spring-time) –AR1, MC:223, TUY       
  EARTH cemen (soil). (Note: at the time Tolkien wrote Etym, he thought of cemen as the genitive of cén, but later cemen evidently became the nominative form, as it had been in earlier writings [LT1:257]. In Silm:433, it is said that cemen [kemen] refers to "the Earth as a flat floor beneath menel, the heavens". LT1:257, reproducing early material, also has cemi "earth, soil, land" and Kémi "Mother Earth".) Locative cemendë "on earth" in VT43:17. HEAVEN AND EARTH Menel Cemenyë (VT47:11). EARTH-QUEEN Kementári (Yavanna's title); EARTHEN, OF EARTH cemna. (LR:363 gves "kemina", but according to VT45:19, this is a misreading for "kemna" in Tolkien's manuscript.) EARTH (= world) Ambar (world) (Tolkien equated Ambar with Oikoumene, a Greek word denoting "world" considered as "the inhabited world of Men". But ambar also seems to mean "doom", q.v. MR:337 (cf. WJ:419) has Imbar instead of Ambar; the literal meaning of both words is said to be "habitation") EARTH-DWELLERS –LT2:343 gives indi, rendered "earthdwellers" and said to be another word for "men", but this is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. –KEM/Silm:433/LT1:257/VT44:34, MBAR cf. Letters:283 or SD:409
  EASEMENT (noun) tiutalë (comfort, consolation) –QL:93
  EAST rómen (allative Rómenna as a region of Númenor and ablative Rómello in Namárië are capitalized), róna; EASTERN rómenya (Entar, Entardar "Outer Lands, Middle-earth" is also glossed as "East" once, as opposed to the Blessed Realm of the West.) The words órë "dawn, Sunrise, East" and its corresponding adjective órëa (LT1:264) are probably not valid words in LotR-style Quenya; see DAWN. Neither can Ostar "East" be a valid word; see GATE. EAST-VICTOR Rómendacil (one of the Kings of Gondor) EAST-LANDS Orrostar (a region in Númenor). EAST-HELPER (masc. name) Rómestámo, Róme(n)star (so in PM:384, 391; probably ?Rómenstar must always become Rómestar, but Tolkien cited the form as Róme(n)star to indicate the connection with rómen "east") –RŌ/LotR:1157, UT:463, Nam, EN, LotR:1075, 1081, UT:165, 459, PM:384, 391)
  EAT mat-, mata- (pa.t. mantë is given), future-past matumnë "was going to eat" –MAT, VT39:7, VT48:32

  EDDY hwinya- (swirl, gyrate); hwindë (whirlpool) –SWIN
  EDGE réna, ríma –REG, RĪ
  EGLATH (or EGLAIN, EGLADHRIM) Heceldi (the "Forsaken" Elves, especially the Eldar left in Beleriand; sg Hecel is given. MR:170 has Ecelli.) –WJ:365 cf. Silm:68
  EIGHT tolto (alternative form toldo). For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. EIGHTH toltëa, toldëa. Fraction ONE EIGHTH tolosta, tosta, tolsat. –TOL1-OTH/OT, VT42:25, 31, VT48:6, 11
  EIGHTEEN toloquë; in duodecimal counting, the word nahta occurs (Note: a homophone means "bite", as noun.) For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. –VT48:21, PE14:17/VT47:42
  EITHER…OR: Christopher Gilson interprets a phrase involving a double var…var as having this meaning in one early (untranslated) text; notice that var was a conjunction “or” in Tolkien’s early “Qenya”. –PE15:32, 39, cf. QL:100
  ELBOW ólemë –LT1:258
  ELEPHANT andamunda –MBUD
  ELEVEN minquë. For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. Fraction ONE ELEVENTH minquesta. –MINIK-W-, LT1:260, VT48:6; unorthodox spelling "minkwe" in VT48:7, 11
  ELF quendë (a technical, generic term, seldom used in the sg; pl Quendi is the usual form; there are gender-specific forms quendu m. and quendi f., but they seem to be rare; pl. forms quendur, quendir are attested), Elda (originally generic, but later [MET] used of Elves of the Three Kindreds [Noldor, Vanyar, Teleri] only. That was at least the proper usage: Elda was the normal word for "elf" in Valinor, since all Elves there were Eldar, and quendë became a word of lore. An archaic variant of Elda was Eldo.) With generic reference, the pl. Eldar has no article and is used to eman “Elves, The Elves, All Elves”; i Eldar with the article means “the Elves” with reference to some particular individuals previously mentioned. The partitive plural Eldali “Elves, some Elves” is also attested (VT49:8). ELVES OF AMAN Amanyar (sg #Amanya), ELVES WHO REFUSED TO JOIN IN THE WESTWARD MARCH (from Cuiviénen) Avari (sg Avar in WJ:371, VT47:13, 24; Avar or Avaro in Etym), also called Avamanyar "those who did not go to Aman, because they would not" (distinguish Úmanyar, Úamanyar, Alamanyar "those who did not in the event reach Aman", though they did join in the march from Cuiviénen; these are also called Heceldi or Ecelli, see EGLATH). See also DARK ELVES, GREEN-ELVES, GREY-ELVES, HIGH-ELVES, LIGHT-ELVES, SEA-ELVES, LITTLE ELF. Cf. also ELVENHOME Eldamar, Elendë. ELF-PEOPLE Eldalië, ELVISH Eldarinwa (adj only, pl. Eldarinwë attested in VT47:14; but "Elvish" meaning Elvish language is simply Eldarin. Properly, these words for "Elvish" apply to the Tree Kindreds only, not to all the Quendi.) Quenderin ("Elvish" referring to all the Quendi, "Quendian"; this remained a learned word) –WJ:361/KWEN(ED), MR:229 ELED, Silm:424, AB/WJ:371/Silm:65/MR:163, WJ:363, Silm:23/392, MR:415, WJ:407
 ELF-FRIEND Elendil (actually meaning *"star-friend". Tolkien notes: "It is not surprising that the Edain...found it difficult to discern whether words and names containing the element el referred to the stars or to the Elves. This is seen in the name Elendil, which was meant to bear the sense "Elf-friend". Properly in Quenya it meant 'a lover or student of the stars'... 'Elf-friend' would have been more correctly represented by Quen(den)dil or Eldandil.") –WJ:410  
 ELF-LOVER (or, “Elf-friend”) #Eldameldo (pl. Eldameldor in WJ:417). Compare FRIEND.
 ELF-STONE Elessar (Aragorn's royal name), stem *Elessarn-, as in the genitive Elesarno (VT49:28, read *Elessarno?) The literal meaning may seem to be Star-stone rather than Elf-stone – but the Edain sometimes confused elen "star" and elda "elf". Cf. Elendil; see ELF-FRIEND. – As a common noun, elessar or “elf-stone” may signify “beryl” (in the chapter Flight to the Ford in the LotR, Aragorn finds “a single pale-green jewel” and declares: “It is a beryl, an elf-stone”). –LotR:395, 897
  ELM-TREE alalmë, lalmë; LAND OF ELMS Alalminórë (Warwickshire) –ÁLAM/LT1:249, LÁLAM

  ENCHANT luhta- (Note: a homophone means "bow"); ENCHANTMENT lúcë –LUK
  ENCIRCLE: Early “Qenya” material has a verb qilti- “gird, encircle” (QL:78); read perhaps *quilta- if the verb is to be adapted to Tolkien’s later Quenya (cf. the noun quilta “belt”). See also GO ROUND (under entry for GO) concerning the verb pel-
  ENCLOSURE panda, tarwa (garden); CIRCULAR ENCLOSURE corin –PAD, QL.87, KOR
  END (noun) metta, mentë, tyel (stem tyeld- as in the pl. tyeldi, misread as "tyelde" in the printed Etymologies; see VT45:25), tyelma, telu; THE ENDING OF THE WORLD Ambar-metta, ambarmetta; END (vb) tele- (intransitive) (finish – so in WJ:411; LT1:267 gives telu-), tyel- (cease), PUT AN END TO metya-, HAVE SOME END IN VIEW mína- (desire to go in some direction, wish to go to a place, make for it) –LotR:1003/VT44:36, MET, LT1:267, WJ:411, KYEL/VT45:25, VT39:11

  ENEMY cotumo –KOT
  ENFOLD vaita- (wrap) –VT46:21, LT1:271
  ENGLAND – see FAËRY.
  ENOUGH farëa (sufficient). "Enough" as an adverb is apparently faren. –PHAR, VT46:9
  ENQUIRY centa (as in Essecenta Eldarinwa, probably meaning *"Enquiry into Eldarin Names", as Tolkien described the work as an "Enquiry into the origins of Elvish names for Elves"; cf. also Osanwe-centa, translated "enquiry into the communication of thought". Another possible translation of centa may be *"essay".) –MR:415, VT39:23

  ENTRANCE TO HARBOUR  londë (road [in sea], also translated "haven" or "fairway") –LOD/VT45:28
  ENVELOPE (noun) vaiya, vaia (both with alternative, possibly older [MET] forms in w-). –WAY
  EXACT PENALTY, see PUNISH
  EXPIRE fírë- (perf. fírië ["has breathed forth"] is attested; *ifírië may be the more usual form) –MR:250 
  ERRANT ránen –RAN
  ESCAPE (vb) usin (glossed "he escapes" in LT:251, but in LotR-style Quenya it would have to mean, if anything, *"I escape" – 1st pers. aorist); ESCAPE (noun) uswë (issue) –LT1:251
 *ESSAY see *ENQUIRY.

  EVER oi, voro, vor (continually) (pref. #oio-, vor-, voro-), EVERWHITE, EVER-SNOW-WHITE Oiolossë (a name for Taniquetil; gen Oiolossëo is attested in Nam, where it has an ablatival meaning); EVERSUMMER Oiolairë, EVERLASTING oia; vorima; EVERLASTING [?AGE] (Tolkien's handwriting was illegible) oirë, oialë; FOR EVER, EVERLASTINGLY oialë (evidently the noun just mentioned used as an adverb), tennoio, oia (the latter is both adj. "everlasting" and the adv. *"everlastingly", according to VT46:8). –OY, UT:458, BOR, LT1:250/273, Nam/RGEO:67, Silm:429, UT:317
  EVERY ilya (each, all of a particular group of things), máca (a very early "Qenya" word of doubtful authority) –VT39:20, GL:41
  EVERYBODY ilquen; EVERYTHING ilqua. For "everything" there is also ilu as a word for the universe: all, the whole; of the universe also including God and all souls and spirits, which are not properly included in the term Eä. –WJ:372, IL/VT45:24, VT39:20
  EVIL (adj.) ulca (see also WICKED), úmëa (but in a later source, the latter is said to mean "abundant, swarming, teaming"), úra (nasty), EVILEYED henulca; EVIL-SMELLING saura (Þ) (foul, putrid) – in one attested compound also #sauri-; see FOUL. EVIL as noun: ulco (stem ulcu- as in the ablative ulcullo; pl. "evils" presumably *ulqui; another version of the relevant text uses úro as the noun "evil"; the adj. ulca is also seemingly used as noun in a sentence apparently meaning “if one speaks evil”, VT49:19). FREE FROM EVIL aman (see BLESSED). –VT49:14, VT43:23-24, SD:68, 72, UGU, THUS, VT43:23-24, WJ:399
  EXALTED arta (lofty, noble). Note: homophones mean "athwart" and also "fort". EXALTED ONES Aratar (pl; sg #Arata). The Aratar are the mightiest of the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos, Nienna, and Oromë. Aratar is also rendered "High Ones, The Supreme" –PM:354, Silm 32/381, WJ:402
  EXCEL lahta- (pass over, cross, surpass) –PE17:92
  EXCEPT hequa (leaving aside, not counting, excluding) –WJ:364, 365

  EXIST ëa (translated “is” in CO; see BE), pa.t. engë, perfect engië or rarely éyë, future euva. EXISTING nanwa (actual, true) –VT39:6, 7, VT43:38, VT49:29, 30
  EXCHANGE quapta- –QL:76
  EXPAND palu-, palya- (spread, extend, open wide); EXPANSIVE palla (wide) –PAL
  EXPIRE fírë- (originally used of "one sighing or releasing a deep breath", but also used of the Elf Míriel when she "breathed forth" and died; later used of the death of mortals. Perf. fírië is attested; *ifírië with prefix sundóma is probably also a possible form.) –MR:250
  EXTEND palu-, palya- (spread, expand, open wide); EXTENDED taina (lengthened, stretched, elongated); EXTENSION tailë (lengthening) –PAL, TAY
  EXTENSIVE yonda (wide, roomy) –PE17:43
  EXTREMELY langë (surpassingly, superlatively) –PE17:92
  EYE hen (hend-) (normal pl. hendi as well as the dual form #hendu are attested [isolated from hendumaica, WJ:337]; #hendu would be used of a natural pair of eyes). SHARP-EYE hendumaica, EYES OF HEARTSEASE (a name of the pansy) Helinyetillë –KHEN-D-E, WJ:337, LT1:262
  EYRIE sornion (Þ) (lit. gen.pl "of eagles"?). –LT1:266. (LT1:251 gives ëaren, but this is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya [see EAGLE])

  <F>
  FACE cendelë, anta; SWEET-FACED raina (smiling, gracious). NOTE: A homophone means "nettled, enlaced". –VT49:21, ANA, VT44:35
  FADE sinta- (Þ) (pa.t. sintanë is given, though it seems perfectly regular), fir- (die), fifíru- ("slowly fade away", frequentative form of fir-; the participal form fifírula is attested); FADING quellë (In the Calendar of Imladris, quellë was a precisely defined period of 54 days in late autumn. Also called lasselanta; see AUTUMN.)  –THIN, MC:222/223, LotR:1141

  FAINT néca (vague, dim to see) –MC:222/223
  FAIR (1) (adjective) vanima (beautiful, proper, right), vanë, melima, linda (the last word = fair/beautiful of sound, VT45:27); FAIR FOLK Vanimo (pl. Vanimor is given but seems perfectly regular; the word is said to apply to the "children of the Valar"). FAIR-MINDED faila (generous, just), NOT FAIR úvanima (ugly) FAIRWAY (= navigable channel for ships) londë (road in sea). –BAN/VT39:14, LT1:272, MEL, SLIN, PM:352, VT39:14, VT45:28
  FAIR (2) (noun): Carl F. Hostetter suggests that the untranslated word parma-restalyanna means *”upon your book-fair”, pointing to #resta as a word for “fair” in this sense. The word is elsewhere defined as “field” (q.v.), and the word may refer to a “fair” held in a field, though Hostetter also suggests a possible connection with ré “day” (VT49:39-40).
  FAITHFUL voronda, vórima (steadfast) –UT:317, LT1:250
  FALL (vb) lanta- (pres. pl. lantar, pl. past lantaner, future lantuva and part. #lantala are attested); FALL (noun) lanta or #lantë. (The first of these words occurs in the compound lasselanta "leaf-fall, Autumn", while #lantë is isolated from Noldolantë "the Fall of the Noldor". From these examples it appears that a lanta is a physical fall, while a lantë is a moral fall. Perhaps the latter word can also be applied to a military defeat, as in "the fall of Gondolin".) THE FALLEN (= Númenor) Atalantë  –DAT/DANT/MC:222, Nam, SD:246, VT49:47, LT1:254, Silm:102/414, TALÁT

  FAREWELL namárië –Nam
  FARMER nandor (perhaps obsolete in LotR-style Quenya, clashing with the name of the Nandor, a tribe of Elves) –LT1:261
  FASTEN #tac- (listed as tacë, 3rd pers. sg. aorist), pa.t. tancë. –TAK
  FAT (adj.) tiuca (thick), lárëa (rich); GROW FAT tiuya- (swell). FAT (noun) lar (also used = riches), larma (the latter possibly "pig-fat"; the first part of the gloss is not certainly legible in Tolkien's manuscript. Another gloss of larma is "flesh"; in a later source a similar word is used for “raiment”.) –TIW, VT45:26
  FATE umbar (umbart-) (doom; the form amarto in LT2:348 could be obsolete, but ambar from the same source may be a valid word also in LotR-style Quenya – see DOOM), marto (fortune, lot); manar, mandë (doom, final end, fortune [usually = final bliss]); FATED marta (which adjective also seems to be the noun "fate" in later sources; see VT45:33, VT46:13). *LIGHT-FATED calambar –MBARAT/LotR:1157, MANAD, VT45:33/VT46:12, VT49:41, 42
  FATHER atar (pl. atari in Etym, though the pl. form #atári occurs as part of the compound Atanatári). Dative ataren is attested (VT43:36-37). Forms like atar, atarinya ("my father") as well as atya "daddy" are said to be forms a child would use in addressing his or her father (VT47:26; see DADDY). In VT48:19, atya is explained as a contraction of at-nya "my father". The final version of the Lord's Prayer (VT43:12, 13) has #Átar with a long initial vowel (Átaremma "our father"); this #Átar may incorporate the vocative particle a (*a Atar "o Father" > #Átar). FATHER OF ALL Ilúvatar (God). –Silm:428, 229/ATA/LT1:255, VT44:16, Silm:404/UT:446, VT43:37

  FËANOR Fëanáro (Spirit of Fire) –Silm:397/435, MR:217
  FEAR (noun) caurë; FEAR (vb) #ruc- (the 1st person aorist rucin is glossed "I feel fear or horror", constructed with "from" of the object feared, e.g. *rucin Orcollon "I fear Orcs") –LT1:257, WJ:415
  FEAST meren (merend-), merendë (festival); FESTIVE merya –MBER
  FEATHER quessë –KWES, LotR:1157
  FEBRUARY Nénimë (Amillion in LT1:249 is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya.) –LotR:1144
  FEEL: The noun felmë "emotion" (q.v.) or *"feeling" may suggest a verbal stem #fel- (compare melmë vs. mel-, "love" as noun and verb). This #fel- could then mean "to feel" in the general sense of "have an emotion". Other senses, see below.
  FEEL FEAR OR HORROR #ruc- (cited in source as rucin, 1st pers. aorist), constructed with "from" of the object feared. –WJ:415

  FETCH tulta- (send for, summon) –TUL
  FEY marta (fated) –MBARAT

  FIERY uruitë, úruva (The stem from which these words are derived was struck out in Etym. However, several words that must be derived from this stem occur in LotR, indicating that Tolkien restored it. LT1:248 also gives sára "fiery", but this word is probably obsoleted by sára "bitter" in Etym.) –UR
  FIFTEEN lepenquë –VT48:21 (the form quailepen seems to be another, possibly experimental, word for "15" in Quenya). For the syntax of numerals, see THREE.
  FIFTH lempëa, replacing older (MET) lemenya. Fraction ONE FIFTH lepesta, lepsat –VT42:25, VT48:11

  FINARFIN Arafinwë –MR:230
  FIND #hir- (only fut hiruva is attested), #tuv- (only perf #utúvië is attested [with pronominal endings: utúvienyes "I have found it"]). It is difficult to say what distintion in meaning there may be between these words (if any at all); the verb #tuv- is evidently the same as tuvu- in GL:71, there glossed "receive". –Nam/RGEO:67, LotR:1008 
  FINE tereva (acute, piercing); FINE PIERCED HOLE terra –TER, VT46:18
  FINE FLOUR mulma –QL:63
  FINE RAIN rossë (dew, spray) –ROS cf. Letters:282
  FINGER (noun) leper (pl. leperi given). In an earlier source, the Etymologies, Tolkien gave the Quenya word for "finger" as lepsë (possibly with stem lepsi-, as indicated by the deleted ancestral form lepti, see VT45:27). The term ortil (ortill-, pl. ortilli given), "up-point", is also used for "finger". Special words for the various fingers, see THUMB, INDEX FINGER/FIRST FINGER, MIDDLE FINGER, FOURTH FINGER, LITTLE FINGER. Adj. FINGERED #lepta (isolated from raccalepta "clawfingered") PICK (UP, OUT) WITH THE FINGERS or FEEL WITH FINGERTIPS lepta- –VT44:16/VT45:27/VT47:10 14, 24, LEP, SD:68, 72
  FINGER (vb) lepta- (feel with fingertips; to pick up/out with the fingers) –VT44:16, VT47:10, 25
  FINGOLFIN Nolofinwë –PM:344 (In the source,, Nolofinwë is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the spelling of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) 
  FINGON Findecáno –PM:345
  FINISH (vb) tele- (intransitive) (end) (so in WJ:411 – LT1:267 gives telu-) telya- (transitive) (wind up, conclude). Cf. also telma "conclusion, anything used to finish off a work or affair", "often applied to the last item in a structure, such as a coping-stone, or a topmost pinnacle." FINISH (noun) telu –WJ:411, LT1:267
  FINROD Findaráto –Silm:428/PM:346
  FIRE ruinë (“a [concrete] fire, a blaze”), also úr (the stem from which this word is derived was struck out in Etym. However, several words that must be derived from this stem occur in LotR, indicating that Tolkien restored it). A more general word for "fire" (as an element, PE17:183)  is nár, nárë, which appear (with the masculine ending -o) in the following names:) SPIRIT OF FIRE Fëanáro (Fëanor), FELL FIRE Aicanáro (Sharp Flame, Aegnor) (so in Silm:435; MR:323 has Aicanár). LT1:265 has sá "fire", poetic form sai, also sairin "fiery"; cf. also Sáya "the fire-fay" in GL:66. LT:271 has the following "fire"-words: FIRE uru, FIERY uruvoitë, ON FIRE urwa, LIKE FIRE urúva. Cf. also FIREWOOD turu (but the word was also used of wood in general). BOWL OF FIRE tanyasalpë (evindently #tanya "fire" + #salpë "bowl") –PE17:183, UR/VT46:20, Silm:397, MR:217, LT1:265, 270, 271, 292
  FIRM tulca (strong, immovable, steadfast; Note: there is a homophone verb meaning "fix, set up, establish"), tulunca (steady), sanda (true, abiding), tanca (fixed, sure) –TULUK, LT1:270, STAN, TAK
  FIRST minya (cf. Minyar "Firsts", the first clan among the Elves), inga (this is also a noun "top"), *yesta (but this is a noun “beginning” according to a later source, PE17:120), FIRSTBORN (= the Elves) Minnónar, sg. #Minnóna. (*Yesta is emended from the actual reading esta; see BEGINNING. For FIRSTBORN, Etym has Estanessi, which would similarly become *Yestanessi, but this word is propably obsoleted by the later [TLT] form Minnónar. Writers should use the latter word.) FIRST-BEGOTTEN Minyon (a personal name. The element yon, translated "begotten", may be a reduced form of yondo "son". Alternatively, and perhaps more likely, Minyon may be the adjective minya "first" turned into a masculine name by adding the masculine ending -on. In that case, the literal meaning is simply *"First One". But it is possible that on is actually derived from the stem ONO "beget", and that "First-begotten" really is the literal meaning.) FIRST FINGER lepetas (evidently lepetass-) (index finger), also tassa –MIN/Silm:434/WJ:420, ING, ESE, WJ:403, VT47:10, VT48:5
  FISH lingwë (stem *lingwi-) (perhaps the general word, as opposed to hala), SMALL FISH hala, "FISH-WATCHER" (i.e., kingsfisher, a bird) halatir (halatirn-) or halatirno –LIW, SKAL2, TIR
  FIST quár, quárë (often used to mean "hand"). "Its chief use was in reference to the tightly closed hand as in using an implement or a craft-tool rather than the 'fist' as used in punching" (VT47:8). In compounds –quar: Telperinquar = Sindarin Celebrimbor, "Silver-Fist, Hand of Silver". The first version of the stem KWAR yielded quár pl. quari. –KWAR, Silm:429/387
  FIT (adj.) mára (useful, good); TO (MAKE) FIT camta- (sic; the cluster mt seems unusual for Quenya, but while the source does not explicitly say that this word is Quenya, it is difficult to understand what other language could be intended) (suit, accomodate, adapt) –MAG, VT44:14
  FIVE lempë (alternative form lemen in VT48:6). For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. GROUP OF FIVE (5 similar things) maqua (basically "hand", with 5 fingers), PAIR OF FIVES maquat (see GROUP OF TEN). For ordinals and fractions, see FIFTH. –LEP/GL:53, VT47:7, 10, 24
  FIX panya- (set), tulca- (establish, set up. Note: there is a homophone adjective meaning "firm, steadfast, strong, immoveable"); FIXED tanca (sure, firm); BE FIXED mar- (abide, be settled). FIXED TIME asar (-th-, Vanyarin athar) (festival), FIXED IDEA see IDEA –PAN, LT1:270 cf. TULUK, TAK, UT:317, WJ:399
  FLAG ambal (shaped stone) –MBAL
  FLAME nár, nárë (also translated "fire"), velca; SHARP-FLAME Aicanáro (so in Silm:435; MR:323 has Aicanár), (Aegnor, Fell Fire), RED FLAME rúnya; HEART OF FLAME Naira (a name of the Sun), FLAME-COLOURED culina, culda (golden-red) –NAR1, LT1:260, Silm:437, MR:198, KUL
  FLAT lára; FLAT OF THE HAND, see PALM. –DAL 
  FLEECE uë –LT1:249
  FLASHING OR [?STARRY] LIGHT élë –VT45:12
  FLESH hrávë, larma (the latter also = "[?pig-]fat"; the first part of the gloss is not certainly legible; note that #larma is used = “raiment” in a later source), sarco; FLESHY sarqua –MR:349, VT45:26, LT2:347
  FLING hat- (cited as hatin “I fling”, first person sg. aorist), pa.t. hantë (QL:39; compare the root KHAT “hurl”, LR:363). The apparently related noun hatal “spear” occurring in late material (VT49:14) suggests that Tolkien eventually decided to maintain this word, though in the meantime, a distinct verb hat- “break asunder” had occurred in his writings.
  FLINTHEARTED sincahonda –LotR:1015 cf. SD:68, 72
?FLINTSTONE #sinca (isolated from sincahonda "flinthearted") –LotR:1015 cf. SD:68, 72
  FLOAT lutu- (LT1:273 has wili- "sail, float, fly", but see FLY.) –LT1:249
  FLOCK lámárë –QL:50
  FLOOD (verb) luita-, also oloiya- (inundate). –VT48:23, VT42:10
  FLOOD (noun) luimë (high tide), GREAT FLOOD oloirë. For FLOOD in the sense of “tide” cf. rather celumë (stream, flow, flowing), ulundë, lúto; FLOODING (adj) úlëa (flowing, pouring) –VT48:23, 24, VT42:10, ULU, KEL/MC:223, LT1:249
  FLOOR talan (#talam-, as in pl. talami) (ground); PAVED FLOOR paca (court) –TAL, GL:63
  FLOUR porë (stem *pori-) (meal); FINE FLOUR mulma –POR, QL:63
  FLOURISH (noun) rincë (stem *rinci-) (quick stroke) –RIK, VT46:11 (the latter source indicating that the proper reading is "quick stroke", not "quick shake" as in the Etymologies as printed in LR)
  FLOW (vb) sir-, lutta-, lutu-; FLOW, FLOWING (noun) celumë (stream, flood); FLOWING (adj) úlëa (flooding, pouring), sírima (liquid). –SIR, LT1:249, KEL/MC:223, LT1:265
  FLOWER (large and single) lótë (often -lot in compounds). (The word lótë is usually applied to a large, single flower. From *ambalotsë "uprising-flower" [q.v.] #lotsë can be isolated; this may be the more general word for "flower".) FLOWER OF THE WEST (a floral design) Númellóte. Cf. also indil, "lily, or other large single flower".  PUT FORTH LEAVES OR FLOWERS *lohta- (emended from the actual reading lokta because Tolkien later decided that kt became ht in Quenya) (sprout) –LOT(H), LT1:259, WJ:318, UT:227, 458, WJ:399, LT:258
  FLUTE simpa, simpina (pipe); FLUTER timpinen –LT1:266, 268
  FLUTTERING TO AND FRO wilwa –MC:223
  FLY (verb) #wil- (cited in source as wilin "I fly", 1st pers. aorist), pa.t. willë (cf. wili- "sail, float, fly" in LT1:273). In exilic Quenya, read v- for w- in these words. FLY TO (i.e. "escape to") #ruc- (+ allative, e.g. *rucin i orontinnar "I fly to the mountains"; the verb ruc- otherwise means "fear", constructed with "from" of the object feared); FLY OR STREAM IN THE WIND hlapu- (part. hlápula is attested), FLYING rimpa (rushing); SEND FLYING horta- –WIL, VT44:7, MC:223, RIP, KHOR
  FLY (noun) pí (small insect) –VT47:35
  FOAM (vb) falasta- (part. falastala is attested); FOAM (noun) fallë, winga (spray), wingë (wingi-) (crest [of wave], spindrift). –MC:222/223, PHAL, WIG, LT1:273
  FOG hísë (Þ) (hísi-) (mist. Note: a homophone means "dusk"), hiswë, hui (murk, dark, night) –KHIS, LT1:253
  FOIL (plant) is translated by asëa (Þ) in the name of the plant asëa aranion “kingsfoil”. According to PE17:148, asëa is the Quenya name of the athelas plant, a term related to words for “ease” or “comfort” (because of the healing properties of the plant). –LotR:899
  FOLIAGE olassië (collection of leaves), farnë (archaic faznë). Note that farnë is also the pa.t. of farya- as well as a word for "dwelling", so olassië is the less ambiguous term. –Letters:282, VT46:9
  FOLK hos –LT2:340
  FOLLOW hilya- FOLLOWER neuro; FOLLOWERS (an Elvish name of Men) Hildor, Hildi (unattested sg #Hildo; dative pl hildin is attested; cf also Hildinyar "my heirs" in Elendil's Oath). FOLLOWING THAT epeta, epta (thereupon, thence, whereupon) –KHIL/Silm:116/122/403, FS/WJ:387, LotR:1003, 1004, VT49:12
  FOOD matso, in an earlier source also matl (read *matil since Tolkien decided that final syllabic -l became -il in Quenya); COOKED FOOD apsa –PE16:141, QL:59, AP
  FOOT tál (tal-) (These forms probably obsolete tala pl talwi in LT2:347.) FOOTPRINT runya (slot) –TAL, RUN      
  FOR an (Nam: an sí...Varda...máryat...ortanë, "for now...Varda...has uplifted her hands". Note: an is also glossed "to, till".) English "for" meaning "for the benefit of" will often be rendered by the dative ending -n (pl -in); e.g. nin "for me". As for "for" meaning "on behalf of", see BEHALF. –Nam, VT49:18
  FORBID #váquet- (refuse, say no) (1st pers. sg aorist and past váquetin, váquenten are given in source), avaquet- (refuse) (pa.t. is no doubt *avaquentë; cf. quet- under SAY) –WJ:370, KWET
   FORCE (noun, = pressure to do something against one's will or conscience) sahtië (Þ) (pressure) –VT43:22
   FORCE (in a given direction) (vb.) nir- (thrust, press). ("Though applicable to the pressure of a person on others, by mind and 'will' as well as by physical strength, [this verb] could also be used of physical pressures exerted by inanimates.") Given as a 1st person aorist nirin. Pa.t. probably *nindë since the R of nir- was originally D (the base is given as NID; compare rer- pa.t. rendë from RED concerning the past tense; see SOW). –VT41:17
#FORD tarna (This gloss is isolated from Taruktarna "Oxford", q.v. Tolkien glossed tarna as "crossing, passage") –LT1:347
 FOREHEAD timbarë –PE14:117
 FOREIGN ettelëa ("ettelen" in the printed Etymologies is probably a misreading; see VT45:12); this word may also be a noun "stranger", q.v. FOREIGN PARTS ettelë (outer lands) (but the Quenya word is singular) –ET, VT45:12 
 FORESIGHT *apacen (lit. *"after-sight", a vision of something that will come after the present. In MR:216, apacenyë is translated "foresight"; yet the context and the form of the word itself clearly indicates that it is actually the pl. form of an adjective #apacenya "of foresight". The noun "foresight" is almost certainly *apacen; cf. tercen "insight".) –MR:216
  FOREST taurë ([great] wood) (pl. tauri is attested), tauno, málos (the two latter may not be valid words in Tolkien's later Quenya) –TAWAR/Silm:438/MC:222 cf 215/VT39:7, LT2:342, LT1:267
  FORGE – LT1:250 gives tamin, but this verb is probably obsoleted by tamin "I tap" in Etym.
  FORGIVE #avatyar- (imperative avatyara and the pl. aorist avatyarir are attested). The matter that is forgiven is the direct object, whereas the person that is forgiven appears in the ablative case: avatyara mello lucassemmar, "forgive us [lit. from us] our debts". This verb #avatyar- occurs in certain versions of Tolkien's Quenya rendering of the Lord's Prayer; in the latest version he introduced the verb apsene- "remit, release, forgive" instead, with a slightly different syntax: the matter forgiven is still the direct object, but the person forgiven now appears in the dative case. The exact etymology of apsene- is somewhat obscure; the prefix ap- is apparently derived from a root AB- in a meaning which Tolkien according to other sources abandoned (see VT43:18-19); also, it is unclear whether the final –e of apsene- is just the connecting vowel of the aorist (before endings we would rather expect *apseni-) or an integral part of the verbal stem, which would make this an "E-stem" verb otherwise hardly attested. The verb apsene- is once attested with the object ending -t "them" attached: apsenet "[as we] forgive them". The alternative verb #avatyar- is for many reasons less problematic and may be preferred by writers. –VT43:8, 9, 18-20
  FORLORN úna (deprived of, destitute) –VT39:14
  FORM car- (make, q.v.) –WJ:391
  FORMER noa (also used = “yesterday”, shortened from the phrase noa ré “former day”), THE FORMER yara (that); FORMER DAYS yárë; FORMER TIMES yalúmë; FORMERLY yá (ago), BELONGING TO OR DESCENDING FROM FORMER TIMES yára (ancient, old) –VT49:34, YA
  FORSAKE hehta- (pa.t. hehtanë is given but seems perfectly regular) (put aside, leave out, exclude, abandon); FORSAKEN ELVES see EGLATH. ONE LOST OR FORSAKEN BY FRIENDS hecil (gender-spesific forms are hecilo m. and hecilë f.) (waif, outcast, outlaw) –WJ:365
  FORT arta (fortress) (Note: arta also means "across, athwart" as well as "exalted, lofty, noble”), ostirion –GARAT (see 3AR), TI:423
  FORTH et- (prefix) (out). Also attested with various pronominal suffixes, e.g. etel or etelyë *”out of you”. GO FORTH TOWARDS tenta-, pa.t. tentanë (with the thing approached as direct object). –ET, VT49:12, 23
  FORTRESS arta (fort) (Note: arta also means "across, athwart") –GARAT (see 3AR)
  FORTUNE (good fortune) alma (weal, wealth); mandë, manar (final end, doom, fate); heren (governance, what is in store for one or what one has in store); marto (fate, lot); FORTUNATE herenya (wealthy, blessed, rich), GOOD OR FORTUNATE THING mána (see BOON). –GALA, MAN/MANAD, KHER, LT2:348, VT49:41
  FORWARD póna, ompa –VT49:12
  FOUL saura (Þ) (evil-smelling, putrid); in compounds sauri- as in FOULBELLIED sauricumba. The latter form may indicate that this adjective also appears in an alternative form *saurë, sauri-. –THUS, SD:68, 72
  FOUNDATION talma (base, root) –TAL
  FOUNTAIN ehtelë (issue of water, spring).The actual reading in LT1 and LT2 is ektelë, but Tolkien later decided that kt became ht in Quenya. The new form of the word is attested in Silm. LT also gives the form kektelë, that would likewise become *cehtelë.) –LT1:257, LT2:338
  FOUR canta, (prefix:) can- For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. –KANÁT, VT45:18, VT48:6
  FOURTEEN ?canaquë –VT48:21 (the form listed, "kanakwe", seems to be Common Eldarin; the Quenya form could be either *canaquë or *canquë). The form quaican seems to be another, possibly experimental, word for "14" in Quenya. For the syntax of numerals, see THREE.
  FOURTH cantëa; FOURTH FINGER (the digit between the long finger and the little finger) lepecan, lepentë, in children's play also called nettë (prob. netti-), "sister", a word also used for the fourth toe, or in two-hand play for the ninth digit. The word selyë "daughter" was also introduced as a name for the fourth finger/toe in childrens play (VT47:10), but Tolkien apparently abandoned it (VT47:15). Fraction ONE FOURTH canasta, casta, cansat. –VT42:25, VT47:10-12, 15, VT48:5
  FOWL (barn fowl) porocë (hen) –PE16:132
  FOX rusco (stem ruscu-, pl. rusqui); FOXY ruscuitë –PM:353, VT41:10
  FREE (adj.) léra, aranya (not to be confused with aranya *"my king"; the shorter form ranya also cited must not be confused with the verb "stray, wander"), mirima (but a very similar word, mírima, is rather assigned the meaning “very valuable” in Tolkien’s later Quenya). The previous words are apparently used to describe “free” persons, whereas the following refer to inanimates: latin, latina (open, cleared [of land]), lerina ("free" of things in the sense of "not guarded, reserved, made fast, or 'owned'", VT41:5). Lehta “free, released” (perhaps applicable to persons, but cf. the following:) FREE ELEMENT (a term for "vowel") #lehta tengwë (only pl. lehta tengwi is attested; we would rather expect *lehtë tengwi). (A word fairë "free" is mentioned in LT1:250, but may be obsolete: several other meanings are attributed to this word in later writings [see DEATH, PHANTOM, RADIANCE]. Fairië "freedom" does not clash with later words, but must probably be considered conceptually obsolete if fairë is so regarded.) FREE FROM EVIL aman (see BLESSED) –VT41:5, VT46:10, MIS, LAT, VT39:17, WJ:399
  FREE (verb) rúna- (see DELIVER); SET FREE lerya- (release, let go), sen- (let go, let loose) –VT43:23, VT41:5, 6, VT43:18
  FREEZE niquë- ("it is cold, it freezes"). LT1:254 gives hilcin "it freezes", but in LotR-style Quenya this will have to mean, if anything, "I freeze" (1st pers. aorist). –WJ:417, LT1:254
  FREQUENT rimba –RIM
  FRESH venya, archaic wenya (yellow-green, green), virya, céva (new). FRESHNESS vén, wén (youth, greenness) –GWEN, VT46:22, VT48:7,8
  FRESHET celussë (water falling out swiftly from a rocky spring) –UT:42 6
  FRIEND meldo (pl meldor is attested). MY FRIEND meldonya (VT49:40). Apparently meldo is a masculine form, corresponding to feminine #meldë (cf. meldenya *"my friend" in the Elaine inscription, Tolkien here referring to Elaine Griffiths). Other words for "friend": nildo (m.), nildë (f.), sermo, seron (m.), sermë (f.), málo (m.?), -ser (final element in compounds), –(n)dil (final element in compounds, e.g. Elendil, Anardil, Valandil – sometimes translated "lover" rather than "friend". When the first part of the compound ends in l, n, or r, the n of -ndil is left out).The final element -ndil also appears in the variant form -nil and with the longer forms -nildo, -dildo (VT46:4). FRIENDLY nilda (lovely), FRIENDSHIP nilmë –WJ:412 cf. VT45:34, NIL, SER, MEL, Letters:386
  FROG quácë –VT47:36
  FROM: Independent Quenya prepositons for "from" include ho and va, var. However, English "from" will often be rendered using the ablative case, endings -llo, pl -llon or -llor, dual -lto, e.g. Eärello *"from the Sea". The preposition et "forth, out" may also express "out" and is combined with a following noun in the ablative case to express "out from", "out of". –3O, VT43:20, 24, LotR:1003, VT44:35
  FRONT – BEFORE, IN FRONT OF (of spatial relationships) opo, pó (VT49:12, also pono, poto-, VT49:32)
  FROST nixë, ringwë (rime), FROST-PATTERNS niquis, niquessë (the latter by association with quessë "feather") –WJ:417, LT1:265
  FROZEN halcin –LT1:254
  FRUIT yávë (so in Etym, Silm:439, and VT43:31; LT1:273 has yáva, whereas yava appears in VT43:31). BEAR FRUIT yavin (which must mean *"I bear fruit", stem #yav-. Tolkien often employs the 1st person aorist when mentioning a verb in his wordlists.) –YAB, LT1:273
  FULL quanta (+ genitive to express "full of", as in quanta Eruanno "full of grace", VT43:28); FULL TO THE BRIM, WITH MOUTH FULL penquanta ("peñ-). Adverb FULLY aqua (completely, altogether, wholly); FULL WRITING (= writing with separate symbols for vowels) quanta sarmë, FULL STOP (in Tengwar punctuation a dot placed under a consonant to indicate that it is not followed by a vowel, VT46:10, 33) pusta (stop), FULL SIGN #quanta tengwë (only pl. quantë tengwi is attested). In early Elvish analysis of Quenya, this was the term for a consonant + a vowel (this was analyzed as a kind of unitary phoneme rather than two phonemes; hence a stem like mata- "eat" was analyzed as two quantë tengwi: ma + ta). –KWAT/VT43:28, VT39:11, WJ:392, VT39:8, PUS
  FUNGUS hwan (hwand-, as in pl. hwandi) (sponge) –SWAD
  FURTHER, FURTHERMORE (adv.) entë (moreover, what is more). The word an may also be used = ”moreover, furthermore, and so – for, to proceed”, but an would often imply “for”, introducing the reason for what has already been said. –VT47:15, VT49:19
     
  <G>
  GALADRIEL Altariel (Altariell-; gen. Altariello is attested. Altariel is the form used in Noldorin Quenya, Galadriel's own mother-tongue; the Telerin form is Alatáriel [UT:266]. According to PM:347, the true Quenya equivalent of the Telerin form would have been Ñaltariel, but this form was apparently not used.) –Silm:433, RGEO:66 
  GALADHRIM (the “tree-people” of Lórien) Ornelië –TI:239
  GAME tyalië (sport, play) –TYAL/LT1:260
  GANDALF Olórin (his name in Valinor, derived from a stem meaning "dream" – not an actual translation of "Gandalf", meaning "Elf of the Wand", a name he was given by people who did not know that he was actually a Maia.) –LotR:391, UT:396 cf. 391 
  GAOL #mando (isolated from Angamando "Iron-Gaol"; mando is also defined as "safe keeping"). –MR:350
  GAP fásë (gulf) –GL:36
  GARDEN tarwa (enclosure) –QL:87
  GARLAND ría (wreathe); MAIDEN CROWNED WITH A FESTIVAL GARLAND riellë –PM:347
  GASH cirissë (slash), hyatsë (cleft) –KIRIS, SYAD
  GATE ando; GREAT GATE andon (pl andondi). (LT1:264 has osto "the gates of the Sun" and Ostor "East", but in Tolkien's later Quenya osto means "town" or "fortress".) –AD, LotR:1157, LT1:264
  GATHER comya- (assemble), hosta- (collect, assemble); GATHERING (of three or more coming from different directions) yomenië (meeting) –PE17:158, MC:223, WJ:407    
  GENEROUS faila (fair-minded, just) –PM:352
  GENTLE milya (soft, weak) (Note: milya- is also a verb "long for"), moica (soft), GENTLE BREEZE vílë –VT45:34, GL:58, LT1:273
  GET net- (pa.t. nentë given) – QL:66
  GET LOW (of the Sun) númeta-, númenda- –LT1:263
  GERM erdë (seed. Note: a homophone means "person".) –ERÉD
  GESTURE-CODE hwermë –WJ:395, VT39:5
  GIANT (noun) norsa (Þ) (see also MONSTER). Another word for "giant" (hanaco) was struck out by Tolkien. –NOROTH, VT45:21
  GIFT anna; LAND OF GIFT (a name of Númenor) Andor (haplology of *Annandor), DEAR GIFT (the meaning of Melian's name) Melyanna, GIFT OF GOD, see GRACE. –ANA, Silm:313, 434
  GIMILZÔR Telemnar –UT:223
  GIMLET teret (auger) –LT1:255
  GIRD: Early “Qenya” material has a verb qilti- “gird, encircle” (QL:78); read perhaps *quilta- if the verb is to be adapted to Tolkien’s later Quenya (cf. the noun quilta “belt, girdle”).
  GIRDLE #lesta (isolated from #Lestanórë; see DORIATH. #Lesta is the cognate of Sindarin lest as in Lest [or List] Melian "the Girdle of Melian" [WJ:228]. Note: #lesta also means "measure".) GIRDLE, BELT quilta. –WJ:369, Silm:390, QL:78
  GIRL wen (stem wend-, as in the pl. wendi) (maid). The word seldë was not clearly glossed by Tolkien, but appears to mean "female child", hence "girl". The form wendi "young or small woman, girl" in VT48:18 is perhaps intended as the older form of wendë ("maiden") rather than a "contemporary" Quenya word. The form "wenki" from the same source may have a similar meaning, and again it is possible that this is actually Common Eldarin for Quenya *wencë, wenci-. –LT1:271, VT46:13, VT48:18
  GIVE anta- (pa.t. #antanë is attested in VT49:14 [antanen “I gave”], though the pa.t. “gave” was ánë in early "Qenya", QL:31; possibly both forms are valid in later Quenya as well). In one text, Tolkien apparently used ana as the imperative "give!", but the text was rewritten and this may have been an ephemeral form (VT44:13). GIVE INSTRUCTIONS TO, see INSTRUCT. GIVER antë (f), anto (m) (the latter word from Etym is probably obsoleted by anto "mouth" in LotR:1157 – an alternative word for "[male] giver" might be *antando). Another fem. word for "giver" is #ánië, isolated from massánië (see BREAD-GIVER). –ANA, VT44:13, PM:404
  GIVE BIRTH nosta- (but in later sources, nosta- is glossed "beget", q.v.) –LT1:272
  GIVEN (OR ADDED) NAME anessë (pl anessi is attested. This word encompasses both "after-names" and "mother-names".) –MR:217
  GLAMHOTH Sancossi (see GOBLIN) –LT2:341
  GLASS calca, hyellë, hyelma (the latter perhaps = "a glass", whereas hyellë could be glass as a substance), maril (crystal – perhaps with stem marill-). LITTLE GLASS lipil. Cf. also vírin, "a magic glassy substance of great lucency used in fashioning the Moon" –VT47:35, KHYEL/VT45:23, VT46:13, LT1:258, LT2:339
  GLAURUNG see GLORUND
  GLEAM (WHITE) ilca- (part. ilcala is attested) –MC:223
  GLINT (vb) tinë (pres 3rd pers sg); GLINT (noun) tindë, wintil; GLINTING tinda (silver) –TIN, LT1:261
  GLITTER (vb) mirilya-; GLITTERING rilya (in the Etymologies as printed in LR, this word also seemed to be glossed "brilliance", but according to VT46:11, this gloss properly refers to another word), GLITTERING LIGHT rilma; GLITTERING REFLECTION (from jewels, glass, polished metals, or water) nalta (radiance – alata in Silm:433 is the Telerin form. In PM:347, nalta is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) –MBIRIL, RIL/VT46:11, PM:347
  GLOBE coron (#corn-, as in dat.sg. cornen) (ball); GLOBED corna (round) –KOR
  GLOOM ungwë, lumbë (shadow), huinë (darkness, shadow), lómë (stem lómi-) (night, twilight, darkness, dusk), yaru; GLOOMY morna (black, dark, sombre); CHILD OF GLOOM lómëar (probably not a valid word in LotR-style Quenya) –UÑG, LUM, VT41:8, GL:37, LT1:255, Silm:431
  GLORIOUS alcarinqua (radiant) (The shorter form alcarin is attested in VT44:10 and also as a title of king Atanatar II. Cf. also Alcarinquë, a name of Jupiter.) The form alcarë appears as an adjective "glorious" in VT44:10, but this was apparently an ephemeral form, and the Etymologies, alcarë is rather a longer form of the noun alcar "glory". –AKLA-R-, WJ:412, RGEO:73/LotR:1075/VT44:10, Silm:55
  GLORUND, GLORUNN Laurundo, Undolaurë (Tolkien later changed Glorund to Glaurung. Read *Laurungo, *Ungolaurë in Quenya?) –LT2:341
  GLORY alcar, alcarë (splendour, brilliance) In VT44:10, alcarë is an adjective "glorious" rather than a noun "glory", but this was apparently an ephemeral form. –AKLA-R-/RGEO:73/UT:317/WJ:369/Silm:427, VT43:37, VT44:34, VT47:13
  GLOWING lúsina adj. “glowing” (of things). Note: used of people, the word means “hearty” (QL:57). If this early Qenya term is to be used in LotR-style Quenya, one would have to assyme that it represents earlier lúÞina (root *LUTH) and spell it accordingly in Tengwar.
  GNOME (only = wise one, Noldo) Noldo (spelt Ngoldo [Ñoldo] in Tengwar writing, reflecting the earlier pronounciation); pl. Noldor is attested. GNOMISH (general adjective:) Noldorinwa, (Gnomish language:) Noldorin, GNOME-LAND Noldomar –LT1:262, Silm:61, LotR:1157, VT39:16
  GO lelya- or lenna- (pa.t. lendë in both cases; the printed Etymologies gives "linna" instad of lenna-, but according to VT45:27 this is a misreading) (proceed, travel); #men- (attested in the aorist: menë "goes"), vanya- (pa.t. vannë) (depart, disappear – it may be that Tolkien abandoned the verb vanya-, if it is regarded as the conceptual predecessor of auta-, see GO AWAY below), GO ROUND pel- (revolve, return; the Silmarillion Appendix also mentions “encircle” as a meaning of the root PEL, cf. also “Qenya” pele- “surround, fence in, pen in”; pa.t. pellë given, QL:73). GO OVER, see CROSS. GO ATHWART tara- (cross); GO AWAY auta- (leave, pass); pa.t. oantë, perf. oantië (in the physical sense "went away [to another place]", vánë ("the most frequently used past [tense]" – less "physical" than oantë, rather meaning to be lost or to disappear), also anwë (this pa.t. was "only found in archaic language"), perf. avánië (pl. avánier is attested); perf. vánië with no augment may occur in verse. GO FORTH TOWARDS (with the thing approached as direct object)  tenta-, pa.t. tentanë (the verb can also mean “direct toward” or “be directed toward”, in the intransitive tense apparently with the pa.t. tenantë). CAUSE TO GO (in a desired direction) menta- (send), GONE vanwa (departed, vanished, dead, lost, past and over, no longer to be had) BE GONE! heca! – also with pronominal affixes: sg hecat, pl hecal "you be gone!" (stand aside!) LET GO lerya- (release, set free), sen- (let loose, free) –WJ:363, LED/VT45:27, VT47:11, 30, PEL, LT2:347, WAN, Nam, WJ:364, VT41:5, VT49:23, WJ:366, VT41:5, VT43:18
  GOAT – she-goat: nyéni –LT1:262
  GOBLET súlo (stem *súlu-), fion (but in later material, a word of similar shape is assigned the meaning “hawk” instead) –SUG (see SUK), LT1:253
  GOBLIN (Orc) urco (stem *urcu-, pl urqui) or orco (stem *orcu-, pl. orqui, or stem *orco-, pl. orcor); THE GOBLINS Sancossi (sancë "hateful" + hossi "armies", said to be the Quenya equivalent of Sindarin Glamhoth) 
-ÓROK, LT2:202/MR:74/WJ:390, LT2:341
  GOD Eru ("The One, He that is Alone", "the One God", a proper name that can hardly be used as a common noun meaning "god" in general. The form Eru corresponds to Enu in early “Qenya” material, LT2:343. Genitive Eruo, VT43:32; dative Erun, VT44:32). Other names/titles: Ilúvatar "Father of All", Ainatar *"Holy-Father". GOD (in general, "a god") aino (this word from PE15:72 is the equivalent of ainu within Tolkien's mythos, but since aino could be interpreted as simply a personalized form of aina "holy", it can perhaps be adapted as a general word for "god" or "holy one"). PAGAN GOD ainu, PAGAN GODDESS aini (angelic spirit, holy one). (As Christopher Tolkien notes, the Ainur are of course not "pagan" to the people of Middle-earth. In Etym and Silm, Ainu/Aini is capitalized.) SON OF GOD (Jesus) Eruion, MOTHER OF GOD (Mary, in Tolkien's Quenya renderings of Catholic prayers) Eruamillë (also Eruontari, Eruontarië *"God-begetter") –Silm:15/396/431, Letters:387, VT44:16-17, 34, LT1:248 cf. AYAN and Silm:426, VT43:32, VT44:7, 16-17, 18 34
  GODWINE (name, "God-friend") Valandil (sc. *"Vala-friend") –VT46:4
  GOLD (the metal) malta (so in LotR – Etym has malda [stem SMAL], but cf. the archaic form smalta mentioned under LAWAR); GOLD laurë (= "not the metal but the colour, what we should call golden light", Letters:308, "of light and colour, not of the metal", Silm:433, "not a metallic word. It was applied to those things which we often call 'golden' though they do not much resemble metallic gold: golden light, especially sunlight", RGEO:70, “golden light”, VT49:47, "a word for golden light or colour, never used for the metal", PM:353, "light of the golden Tree Laurelin", LR:368; a "mystic name" of gold, LT1:255 [possibly a notion Tolkien later abandoned]; in LT1:258 and LT2:341 the gloss is simply "gold".) RED GOLD †cullo (obsoleting culu in LT2:341? In LT1:255 culu is said to be a poetic word for "gold", but also used mythically as a name of all red and yellow metals), GOLDEN laurëa (pl laurië is attested; LT1:258 has laurina), GOLDEN-RED culda, culina (flame-coloured); (cf. Silm. Appendix: "cul- 'golden-red' in Culúrien") –LotR:1157/SMAL, Letters:308/RGEO:70/LAWAR, KUL, RGEO:70/Nam, Silm:429  
  GONDOLIN Ondolindë ("Stone Song", so in Silm:149, 415; LT1:254 gives Ondolinda, changed from Ondolin) –LT1:254 
  GONDOR #Ondórë (genitive Ondórëo is attested, VT49:27), also attested in longer form Ondonórë (VT42:17)
  GONE vanwa (departed, lost, past) –WAN, Nam 
  GONG tombo –LT1:269
  GOOD (of things) mára (fit, useful), GOOD (morally good) manë; GOOD OR FORTUNATE THING, see BOON. GOODBYE mára mesta –MAG (see MA3), LT1:260, Arct
  GOODS armar (sg #arma if there is a sg) –3AR
  GOOSE ván, wán (pl. váni is given, but seems perfectly regular) –WA-N-
  GORE nasta (spear-point, spear-head, triangle), nehtë (spearhead, narrow promontory, wedge. Note: a homophone means "honeycomb"), mear (from a root possibly meaning "ooze") –SNAS/VT46:14, UT:282, LT1:260
  GORGE cilya (pass between hills, cleft) (so in Etym, but cf. #cirya in the name Calacirya "Pass of Light" [gen. Calaciryo in Namárië] – though this clashes with cirya "ship". An early version of Namárië actually had Calacilyo, not Calaciryo; see An Introduction to Elvish p. 5) –KIL 
  GORTHAUR Sauron (Þ) –Silm:418 cf. THUS
  GOSPEL evandilyon –QL:36
  GOTHMOG Cosomot (prob. *Cosomoc-, cf the alternative form Cosomoco) –LT1:258    
  GOVERN #tur- (attested as turin "I...govern", 1st pers. aorist), pa.t. turnë (wield, control). LT1:273 has vard- "rule, govern", but this is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. –TUR
  GOVERNANCE heren (fortune) –KHER
  GOVERNOR cáno (chieftain, commander; see COMMANDER for details) –PM:345, 361-362
  GRACE #Eruanna (literally *"God-gift, gift of God"), attested in the genitive form Eruanno. Also #erulissë, literally "God-sweetness" (attested in the instrumental case: erulissenen), or simply lissë, literally "sweetness". The word mána is also used for a grace or boon; see BOON. Adjective HAVING GRACE, perhaps manaitë (the form is not fully explained by Tolkien). –VT43:28, 29, VT44:18, VT49:41, 42
  GRACIOUS raina (smiling, sweet-faced). NOTE: A homophone means "nettled, enlaced". –VT44:35
  GRADE #tyellë (only pl tyeller is attested – note irregular plural instead of the expected form **tyelli) –LotR:1153
  GRAIN orë (ori-) –QL:50
  GRAMMAR tengwesta (system or code of signs) –TEK cf. WJ:394
  GRANDCHILD indyo (descendant) (Indyo looks like Vanyarin Quenya; the combination ndy became ny in Noldorin Quenya [see MIDDLE]. The Noldor likely said inyo, which form occurred in a deleted marginal note in the Etymologies). –ÑGYO(N), VT46:19 
  GRANT lav- (yield, allow) –DAB
  GRASP mapa- (seize). This word was struck out in one of Tolkien's earlier word-lists, but in Etym it was restored. In early material occurs map- "seize, take" with pa.t. nampë. –MAP, LT2:339, QL:59   
  GRASS salquë, (stiff and dry:) sara (Þ) (bent) –SALAK, STAR
  GREAT túra (big), hoa (large), (great in size:) alta (large) (The form alat- is used in compounds when the next word has an initial vowel, as in Alatairë. Tolkien's gloss of alta, alat- was actually illegible, and I give the root meaning of the stem ÁLAT. The meaning of the Quenya word cannot differ too widely from it, for Alatairë is said to correspond to "Noldorin" Belegoer [in LotR-style Sindarin Belegaer], The Great Sea.) – An early [TLT] word for "great", velicë, is possibly obsolete in LotR-style Quenya: In LT1:254 velicë is said to correspond to Gnomish beleg, but according to LR:352 the stem from which beleg is derived is "not found in Q[uenya]". In post-LotR material the words velca, velcë briefly turned up, apparently meaning “large, great, big”, but Tolkien rejected these forms as well.) –PE17:115, ÁLAT, cf. BEL, cf. Silm:428, LT1:254
  GREAT BEAR see SICKLE OF THE VALAR.
  GREAT LONGING mavoinë –LT2:345
  GREAT NUMBER – in a very great number: úvëa (abundant) –UB
  GREAT QUANTITY úvë (abundance) –UB
  GREAT WOOD taurë (forest) –TAWAR
  GREED milmë; GREEDY milca –MIL-IK
  GREEN laica (so in Letters:282; earlier sources have laiqua, whereas laica meant something wholly different ["keen, piercing"] in earlier material: LT2:337), wenya (yellow-green, fresh), ezel, ezella (adopted from Valarin; only used in Vanyarin Quenya)."Green" is expressed as a mere prefix lai- (representing the root underlying the adjective laica) in: GREEN-ELVES Laiquendi; cf. also VERDIGRIS = lairus. GREENNESS wén, laiquassë (freshness, youth). –LÁYAK/LT1:267, WJ:399, GWEN, WJ:385, LT1:267
  GREY #mista (isolated from lassemista "leaf-grey"), also hiswa, but the most usual word for "grey" may be sindë (stem *sindi-) (Þ) or sinda (Þ). (WJ has sindë "pale or silvery grey", wheras sinda is given in Silm:438; cf. also sindanoriello "from a grey land", Sindacollo "Grey-cloak" and Sindar "Grey-Elves, *Grey Ones".)GREY-ELVES Sindar (Þ) (sg. Sinda), less commonly Sindeldi (sg Sindel); GREY-CLOAK Sindacollo, Singollo (Þ) (so in Silm:421; MR:217 has Sindicollo, presupposing sindë, sindi- as the word for "grey"); GREY-ELVEN sindarinwa (adj), Sindarin (= Grey-Elven language) (Þ) –LotR:505 cf. Letters:224, KHIS, LotR:1171, Silm:438, THIN/WJ:384, Nam, Silm:419, WJ:384, LotR:1157, 1161
  GRIEF nyérë (sorrow). Pl. probably *nyérer not *nyéri; cf. the similar formation tyávë "taste" pl. tyáver. The noun nyérë points to a verbal stem *nyer- "grieve". –GL:60/LT1:261
  GROT (small) rotto (cave, tunnel) –PM:365, VT46:12
  GROUND talan (#talam-, as in pl. talami) (floor) –TALAM
  GROUP OF FIVE (5 similar things) maqua (basically "hand", with 5 fingers); GROUP OF TEN (10 similar things) maquat (dual of maqua, here referring to a "pair of fives") –VT47:7, 10
  GROW ol- (not clearly identified as a Quenya word in the source; it may be a primitive root); GROW FAT tiuya- –VT45:13, TIW 
  GROWL (vb) yarra- (snarl), (of dogs:) núru- (grumble); GROWL (noun) nur (complaint) 
-MC:223, LT1:263
  GRUMBLE (vb) nurru- (murmur), núru- (growl [of dogs]). (These may simply be two forms of the same word. Nurru- is by far the later [TLT] form.) GRUMBLING (adj) nurrua –MC:223, LT1:263
  GUARD – use the word glossed "watch, heed", q.v. Cf. LT1:258. For "guard" as a noun, #tirno "watcher" may be isolated from halatirno (see FISHWATCHER)
  GUESS (vb) intya-; GUESS (noun) intya (supposition, idea) –INK
  GUILT cáma (responsibility) –QL:43
  GULF yáwë (cleft, ravine). According to VT46:22, it is possible that the gloss "gulf" actually reads "gully" in Tolkien's manuscript, and the other glosses may support this reading. The word londë (land-locked haven) is translated “gulf” in TI:423. Early “Qenya” has fásë = gulf, gap, but Tolkien’s later Quenya would not have s in this position (unless it represents earlier þ). –YAG, TI:423, GL:36
  GULL maiwë –MIW
  GULLY, see GULF 
  GYRATE hwinya- (eddy, swirl) –SWIN

  <H>         
  HABIT haimë –KHIM
  HABITATION imbar (Imbar was an Elvish name of the Earth as the prinicipal part of Arda; the form Ambar may be more usual and is found in LotR.) –MR:337, WJ:419, 402, LotR:1003 
  HAIL (greeting) aiya (so in LotR; LT1:248 has áyë); variant spelling aia. –LotR:747, 950 cf. Letters:385, VT43:28
  HAIR (a single hair) finë (*fini-) (larch).TANGLED HAIR fassë; LOCK OF HAIR findë (defined as "a tress or plait of hair" in PM:345; LT2:341 has findl, an impossible form in LotR-style Quenya), HEAD OF HAIR, A PERSON'S HAIR AS A WHOLE findessë. The conceptual status of the noun loxë "hair" listed in the Etymologies is uncertain; this word is assigned the meaning "bunch, cluster" elsewhere. –PM:362, PHAS, SPIN, PM:345, LOKH
  HALF-ELVEN (noun, pl) Pereldar (Sindarin Peredhil, LotR:1071). Singular #Perelda. –Letters:386
  HALF: fraction ONE HALF peresta, perta –VT48:11
  HALL #mardë (isolated from oromardi "lofty halls, high-halls"; the singular may also be reconstructed as #mar with stem mard-, which would make this the same word as the word for "home" or "dwelling", q.v.); ROCKHEWN HALL hróta (artificial cave, rockhewn hall), VAULTED HALL rondo –Nam/RGEO:66, PM:365, VT39:9
  HALLOW (verb) #airita- (only pa.t. airitánë is attested) –VT32:7
  HALVE perya- (devide in middle) (After perya, a word perina is mentioned – it is undefined but seems to be a corresponding adjective or past participle *"halved, divided in middle".) –PER  
  HAMMER (vb) namba-; HAMMER (noun) namba –NDAM
  HAMS hacca (buttocks) –GL:47
  HAND má (pl. allative mannar "into...hands" is attested in FS; the long á evidently becomes short a before a consonant cluster).The plural of má is máli, the dual is mát (VT47:6). For maqua as a colloquial term for "hand", and its secondary meanings, see separate entry HAND-FULL. The term palta is used of "the flat of the hand, the hand held upwards or forwards, flat and tensed (with fingers and thumb closed or spread" (VT47:9). Individual hand-names: forma "right hand", hyarma "left hand" (VT47:6, VT49:12). Other terms for "hand": nonda (said to mean "hand, especially in [?clutching]"; Tolkien's gloss was not certainly legible, VT47:23), quárë (this is properly "fist", but was often used for "hand" – see FIST); HOLLOW OF HAND cambë (also used simply = “hand”, as in cambeya “his hand”, VT49:17). A variant of this, camba, is in VT47:7 defined as "the whole hand, but as flexed, with fingers more or less closed, cupped, in the attitude of receiving or holding". HAND-LINK, see WRIST. Adj. HAVING HANDS mavoitë; HANDY, HANDED maitë (stem *maiti-) (skilled) (pl. maisi. When maitë is the final element of names, it is translated "handed" instead of "handy", e.g. Angamaitë "Iron-handed", morimaitë "blackhanded") For other "handed"-related terms, see HEAVYHAND(ED). Compound LANGUAGE OF THE HANDS mátengwië –MA3/LT2:339/VT39:10, FS, VT47:6, 9, 23, KWAR/Silm:429, KAB, LotR:1085 cf. Letters:425, LotR:1015/SD:68, 72, UT:460, VT47:9
  HAND-FULL maqua (dual maquat is attested). Colloquially, the word maqua is also used for the "hand" itself (called má in formal language); maqua may refer to the "complete hand with all five fingers", and the word is therefore also used for a group of 5 similar things (just like the dual maquat may refer to a group of 10 similar things; see FIVE, TEN). –VT47:7
  HANDLE (vb) mahta- (deal with, fight, manage, wield, wield a weapon); pa.t. mahtanë is attested. –MAK/MA3, VT39:11, MA3, VT47:6, 18, 19, VT49:10
  HANDLE (noun) tolma (defined as "protuberance contrieved to serve a purpose, knob, short rounded handle", etc.) –VT47:28
  HANG linga- (dangle) –LING
  HAPPEN – LT2:348 gives mart- "it happens" (impersonal). Perhaps read *marta- in LotR-style Quenya; compare marta- "[to] chance" in QL:63
  HAPPY valin (LT1:272 also gives valimo, but adjectives ending in -o do not occur in LotR-style Quenya), HAPPINESS vald- (so in LT1:272; nom. sg. must be either *val or *valdë) (blessedness) It is highly questionable whether these words from early material quoted in LT1:272 are conceptually "valid" in LotR-style Quenya: Originally, they were meant to be related to the noun Valar, the Gods being termed the "Happy Ones", but Tolkien later re-interpreted Valar as meaning the "Powers". For "happiness" it may be better to use the noun alassë "joy", and for "happy" or "joyful, joyous" many writers have used the neologism *alassëa.
  HARBOUR hópa (haven, bay – obsoleting cópa, cópas in LT1:257); HARBOURAGE hopassë –KHOP
  HARD sarda, nauca (the latter also meaning ill-shapen, twisted, *small – see SMALL.); hranga (hard; awkward, stiff, difficult). Note: hranga- is also a verb “thwart”. ––VT39:17, WJ:413, PE17:154, 185
  HARE lapattë –GL:52
  HARP (vb) nanda-; HARP (noun) nandë; LITTLE HARP nandellë; HARPING (noun, not adjectival participle) nandelë; HARPER nandaro, HARP-PLAYER tyalangan. (In Etym, all but the last of these words are spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if these words are written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) HARP-PLAYING salmë. HARPING ON ONE TUNE vorongandelë ("vorogandele" in the published Etymologies is a misreading; see VT45:7) (continuous repetition) –NGAN, TYAL; cf. LotR:1157, LT1:265, LIN1
  HARSH naraca (rending, violent) (possibly "of sounds", but Tolkien's extra comment is partially illegible) –NÁRAK, VT45:37
  HARVEST yávië (autumn) – evidently obsoleting yávan in LT1:273. In the Calendar of Imladris, yávië was a precisely defined period of 52 days, but the word was also used without any exact definition. Note: here yávië refers to harvest time, and it is unclear whether it can also mean "harvest" in the sense "harvested products", though it is derived from a stem meaning "fruit". –LotR:1142, 1145
  HAS BEEN, see BE
  HASP tangwa (clasp) –TAK
  HASTE ormë (wrath, violence, rushing); HASTY orna, tyelca (agile) –GOR, KHOR, PM:353
  HAT táta –GL:71
  HATE (vb) #tev- (aorist tevë), LT1:258 has mokir "I hate", read *mocin in LotR-style Quenya? Instead of using these early "Qenya" terms, writers may prefer the later verb yelta-, glossed "loathe, abhor" by Tolkien. HATEFUL sancë; HATRED tévië –LT1:268 (according to QL:90, tévië rather than tevië is the correct reading), LT2:341
  HAUBERK ambassë (breastplate) –QL:30
  HAVE – see POSSESS. Cf also NO LONGER TO BE HAD vanwa (gone, dead, departed, lost, past, vanished) HAVE AN IMPULSE horya- (be compelled to do something, set vigorously out to do) –WJ:366, VT45:22
  HAVEN  hópa (harbour, bay) londë (as in Alqualondë "Haven of the Swans", UT:417 – but elsewhere londë is glossed "entrance to harbour, road in sea") –KHOP
 ?HAWK fion (pl fioni, fiondi) (Tolkien's gloss was "not certainly legible; the likeliest interpretation would be 'haste', but 'hawk' is a possibility." The translation "haste" is out of the question, as this word would have no plural form. Besides, a quite different word for "haste" [ormë] is known.) –PHI
  HE, HIM (personal 3rd sg. pronoun): As a pronominal suffix, the entire 3rd person singular “he, she, it” is expressed by the ending -s , e.g. caris *“(s)he/it does” (VT49:16, 48). Sometimes a verb with no pronominal ending whatsoever implies a subject “he, she, it”, e.g. nornë “he ran” (PE17:58), fírië “she has breathed forth” (MR:250), tinë “it glints” (TIN). A distinctly masculine ending -ro does occur in early material (antaváro “he will give”, LR:63), but was apparently abandoned by Tolkien. The ending -s may also appear in the “rare” longer form -së (VT49:51, descended from older -sse, VT49:20), perhaps distinctly personal (cf. násë “he [or she] is” vs. nás “it is”, VT49:27, 30). The ending -s is also attested in object position, e.g. melinyes “I love him” (VT49:21; this could also mean *”I love her” or *”I love it”). “He/she” (or even “it”, when some living thing is concerned) does have a distinct form when it appears as an independent pronoun: se (VT49:37), also with a long vowel (sé, VT49:51) when stressed. (Contrast the use of sa for “it” with reference to non-living things.) The independent form may also appear in object position: melin sé, “I love him [/her]” (VT49:21). Case endings may be added, e.g. allative sena or senna “at him [/her]”, “to him/her” (VT49:14, 45-46); se also appears suffixed to a preposition in the word ósë *”with him/her” (VT43:29). A distinct pronoun hé can be used for “he/she” = “the other”, as in a sentence like “I love him (sé) but not him (hé).” Genitive HIS/HER (or ITS, of a living thing) would normally appear as the ending -rya, e.g. coarya “his house” (WJ:369), máryat “her hands” (Nam), the latter with a dual ending following -rya. “His/her” as an independent word could be *senya (compare ninya “my” vs. ni “I”, nin “for me”). – Reflexive pronoun, see HIMSELF. –VT49:16, 51, VT43:29, VT49:15, LotR:1008
  HEAD cár (cas-) (sic in the Etymologies, but read apparently cás with stem car-; see Quenya-English list for a fuller discussion); nóla (round head, knoll); HEAD OF HAIR findessë (see HAIR). SPEAR-HEAD nasta (spear-point, gore, triangle) –KAS, NDOL, PM:345, SNAS/VT46:14
  HEAL #envinyata- (isolated from the past participle envinyanta "healed". The literal meanings are *"renew" and "renewed", cf. Aragorn's title Envinyatar "Renewer" [q.v.]) –MR:405
  HEAP cumbë (mound) –KUB      
  HEAR #hlar- (only fut hlaruva is attested) –MC:222
  HEARING (adj) lasta (listening) –LAS2
  HEART hón (physical heart), órë (inner mind – concerning this word, see SPIRIT) (Note: a homophone means "rising"), indo (mind, mood), enda (lit. "centre", not referring to the physical organ, but the fëa [soul] or sáma [mind] itself; enda may be the best word to use for the metaphorical “heart” in general), Tolkien’s early “Qenya” also has the word elwen. -HEARTED #honda (isolated from sincahonda "flinthearted"). EYES OF HEARTSEASE (a name of the pansy) Helinyetillë HEART OF FLAME Naira (a name of the Sun), –KHŌ-N-, LotR:1157, ID, VT39:32, LT1:255, LotR:1015 cf. SD:68, 72, LT1:262, MR:198
  HEARTY lúsina (of people – used of things, this adjective means “glowing”). If this early Qenya term is to be used in LotR-style Quenya, one would have to assyme that it represents earlier lúÞina (root *LUTH) and spell it accordingly in Tengwar. –QL:57
  HEAT úrë (The stem from which this word must be derived was struck out in Etym, but the word occurs in LotR itself, indicating that Tolkien restored the stem in question.) SMOULDERING HEAT, RED [?HEAT] (Tolkies handwriting was illegible) yulmë (Note: 
a homophone means "drinking, carousal") –LotR:1157 cf. UR; YUL
  HEAVE #amorta- (only part. amortala is attested), HEAVE (of large and heavy things:) rúma- (shift, move) (part. rúmala is attested) –MC:222 cf. 215, MC:223, 222
  HEAVENS, THE menel (a sg word, "heaven", as opposed to its English translation), ilwë (sky). The form #Eruman that turns up in one version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer (in the locative: Erumandë) appears to include the divine name Eru and must refer to "heaven" as God's abode (but Tolkien simply used menel for "heaven" in earlier versions of the Lord's Prayer). IN HEAVEN (adj., more or less = *HEAVENLY) meneldëa. HEAVEN AND EARTH Menel Cemenyë –Silm:434/MC:222 cf. 215, LT1:255, VT43:12, 16 vs. 10, VT43:10, VT44:16, VT47:11
  HEAVY lunga; HEAVY-HANDED lungumaitë; HEAVY-HAND (as masc. name) Lungumá, Lungumaqua. –LUG, VT47:19
  HEDGE (jagged hedge of spikes) caraxë –KARAK
  HEED cim-, in the sense of "watch" also tir- (tirin "I watch", *"I heed", 1st pers. aorist), pa.t. tirnë; fut. tiruva "shall heed" is attested. –GL:39, MC:222 cf. 214, TIR
  HEIGHT #tárië (only allative tárienna "to the height" is attested) –LotR:989 cf. Letters:308
  HEIR aryon (also haryon is glossed as "heir", but this gloss is paranthetic and "prince" is given as the primary meaning. Hildinyar is translated "my heirs" in Aragorn's oath; it appears that this is actually a form of hildo "follower".) –GAR (see 3AR), LotR:1003, 1004
  HELL Angamando ("Iron-prison", Morgoth's dungeon-fortress in the First Age. This is the form given in MR; Etym has Angamanda, LT1:249/252 has Angamandu/Angamandi or Eremandu "Hells of Iron". In LT1:259, Mandos is glossed "hell", but Mandos was simply the halls of the dead and not a place of torture. GL:51 also has fatanyu.) –MR:350, MBAD 
  HELMET cassa, harna, harpa; the word carma is also used for “helm”, but elsewhere Tolkien indicated that he rather wanted carma to mean “weapon” or “tool”. –KAS, VT45:21, PM:260/PE17:114
  HELP, see BLESS
  HELPER: A word for "helper" is apparently embedded in the compound "East-helper", Rómestámo, Róme(n)star (so in PM:384, 391; probably ?Rómenstar must always become Rómestar, but Tolkien cited the form as Róme(n)star to indicate the connection with rómen "east"). It may be that as an independent word, the -stámo "helper" element would manifest as *sámo (Þ).
  HELPFUL asëa (Þ) (beneficial, kindly) (so according to a late note where the word is derived from *ATHAYA). Also (as noun) used as the name of the healing plant called in Sindarin athelas.
  HEM lanë (lani-), ríma (edge, border), HEM OF ROBE lappa –VT42:8,  RĪ, GL:52
  HEN porocë (barn fowl) –PE16:132
  HENCE (from here) silo, sio –VT49:18
  HER 1. (object form of she) – see HIM (the same forms are used for both genders). 2. HER (genitive, “of her”) -rya (possessive suffix, e.g. aratarya "her sublimity" [WJ:369], máryat "her hands" [Nam].) This ending covers the entire 3rd person sg. and may also translate as "his" and “its”; see HIS for further discussion. –WJ:369, VT49:16
  HERB laiquë –PE17:159
  HERE sís, sissë; also sinomë “here, in this place”. The form si listed in VT49:33 is defined “here”, but this may be a basic root rather than a Quenya word. Símen is used for “here” in Fíriel’s Song (LR:72), but in VT49:33, simen is translated “hither”. –VT49:18, LotR:1003, 1004
  HERSELF (reflexive pronoun) immo (a general sg. reflexive pronoun, covering English "myself, him/herself, yourself"). A specific 3rd person reflexive pronoun "him/herself" is insë (for older imse; it is unclear whether the latter form was in use in later Quenya). See HIMSELF. –VT47:37
  HERO callo (noble man). LT1:268 also has mordo "warrior, hero", but in Tolkien's later Quenya, mordo means "obscurity, shadow, stain, smear, dimness". –KAL
  HEW *pelehta- (emended from the actual reading pelekta-, since Tolkien later decided that kt became ht in Quenya). The verb nac- is defined as “hew, cut” in late material, though in Etym, it was assigned the meaning “bite” instead. –LT2:346, VT49:24
  HIDE #nurta- (verbal stem isolated from the verbal noun nurtalë "hiding" in Silm:120), #lom- (LT1:255 gives lomir "I hide"; this would become *lomin in LotR-style Quenya); moru- –LT1:261
  HIDING nurtalë –Silm:120
  HIDDEN muina (secret), halda (veiled, shadowed, shady), foina, furin/hurin (concealed); DARK OR HIDDEN tumna (low-lying, low, profound, deep) –MUY, SKAL, LT2:340, LT1:271
  HIDEOUS CREATURE ulundo (deformed creature, monster) –ÚLUG
  HIGH tára (lofty, tall), oro- (in compounds: oromardi "high-halls"). The element #Ar- in Arfanyarassë (a name of Taniquetil) is said to mean "high (i.e., noble, revered)". VERY HIGH antara (with Antaro as a corresponding proper name, denoting a mountain in Valinor, VT46:17) (lofty). HIGH HEAVEN tarmenel (locative tarmeneldë also attested), HIGH PLACE #tarmen (pl. locative tarmenissen attested), HIGH
TIDE luimë (flood). –WJ:417, Nam/RGEO:66, WJ:416, VT45:5/VT46:17, VT44:34, VT48:23, 24
  HIGH ELVES Tarquendi; HIGH-ELVES Tareldar –TA, MC:349
  HIGH ONES Aratar (sg #Arata, cf. PM:363). The Aratar are the mightiest of the Valar: Manwë, Varda, Ulmo, Yavanna, Aulë, Mandos, Nienna, and Oromë. Aratar is also rendered "The Supreme, Exalted Ones". –Silm 32/381, WJ:402  
  HIGH SPEECH (= Quenya) Tarquesta –TĀ   
  HILL ambo (allative pl. ambonnar is attested); tundo (stem *tundu-) (mound), oro; ISOLATED ROUND HILL tolmen (boss of shield) HILL-SIDE amban (upward slope) (probably obsoleting amun(d) in LT2:335) –VT45:5, MC:222, LT1:269, TUN, LT1:256, AM
  HIM (and HER) as object may be expressed by se, sé or (where it follows another pronominal ending) -s, e.g. melin sé or melinyes for “I love him” (/her). These forms are not specifically masculine, but are used of any living person or thing. See HE.
  HIMSELF (reflexive pronoun) immo (a general sg. reflexive pronoun, covering English "myself, him/herself, yourself"). A specific 3rd person reflexive pronoun "him/herself" is insë (for older imse; it is unclear whether the latter form was in use in later Quenya). A reflexive ending “he…himself” (and *”she…herself”) in -ssë existed at one conceptual stage (melissë, “he loves himself”), but it is uncertain how lasting this idea was, and the ending seems prone to confusion with other, similar endings. Another reflective ending is -xë (spelt “-kse” in the source), plural -xer, dual -xet.  –VT47:37, VT49:21, 48
  HINDMOST tella (last); THE HINDMOST Teleri (the Last-comers) –TELES, Silm:421
  HINT (verb) hiuta- –VT46:6 s.v. ÑIW
  HIP oswë –QL:71
  HIS -rya (possessive suffix, e.g. coarya his house. This ending covers the entire 3rd pers sg and also means "her" and *"its".) Nouns ending in a consonant take the shorter form -ya, e.g. talya “his foot”, macilya “his sword” (cf. tál, tal- “foot”, macil “sword”). In colloquial Quenya (which used -rya = “their” rather than “his, her, its”), the ending -ya could be added even to nouns ending in a vowel: cambeya (“k”) “his hand”, yulmaya “his cup”. –WJ:369, PE17:130, VT49:17, 48
  HISTORY nyárë (tale, saga), quenta (narrative, story), quentalë (account, narration), lúmequentalë, lúmequenta (chronological account), HISTORICAL lúmequentalëa. (In VT39:16, quentalë is defined as "narration" or "History", used as an abstract referring to universal History, but also used with particular reference; hence "the history of the Noldor" can be quentalë Noldoron or quentalë Noldorinwa, but this refers to the real events rather than an account of them: that part of universal History which concerned the Noldor.) HISTORICAL ACCOUNT quentasta (any particular arrangement, by some author, of a series of reconds or evidences into a given historical account – not History as such, which is quentalë). THE HISTORY OF THE ELVES I·Eldanyárë –NAR2, KWET/VT39:16, LU, LR:199
  HITHER sir, sira, simen (but in LR:72, símen is used for “here”) –VT49:18, 33
  HIVE nierwes –LT1:262
  HOARD foa (treasure) –LT2:340
  HOBBIT: The genitive plural periandion is attested in the Elaine inscription, suggesting that the Quenya word for "hobbit" is #perian (as in Sindarin) with stem #periand-.
  HOLE ecca, latta (pit – Note: a homophone means "strap"), assa (perforation, opening, mouth), terra (fine pierced hole), unquë (hollow). –PE17:188, DAT, GAS, VT46:18, VT46:20
  HOLIDAY meryalë –MBER 
  HOLLOW (noun) unquë (hole), HOLLOW (adj) unqua, ronta, rotwa; HOLLOW OUT unca-  –UNUK, LotR:1157, LT2:347
  HOLLOWBOLD Návarot (Nogrod, Novrod) –WJ:389
  HOLLY ercassë (probably obsoleting piosenna in LT2:347) –ERÉK
  HOLY airë. The word aina also occurs in a number of sources (e.g. VT44:7, 17-18); according to VT43:32 this word is "obsolete except in Ainur", but it may occur in sources post-dating this statement. Yet another word for "holy", aista, is seemingly only attested in a translation of "holy spirit" which Tolkien later replaced with a form including airë instead (see below). HOLY ONE ainu (m.), aini (f.) (angelic spirit, god); HOLY PLACE yána (fane, sanctuary); HOLY SPIRIT airefëa (other version: fairë aista; both versions are attested with the dative ending -n attached) –Nam, AYAN/WJ:399,, YAN, VT43:36, 37
 HOME már (also used of the "home" or native land of peoples). The stem mar- occurs in the phrase hon-maren, q.v. in the Quenya-English wordlist. VT45:33 and VT46:13 give mar "home, dwelling" with stem mard-, but in Fíriel's Song, this is used = "earth" instead (i-mar "the earth", ablative mardello). Short form mar as the final element of compounds: Eldamar "Elvenhome"; the vowel is also short in Mar-nu-falmar, "the Land [lit. Home] under the Waves". – The word ambar, usually translated "world", is also associated with "home, dwelling" in one source. –Silm:408, 428, VT46:13
  HOMESTEAD osta –LT2:336
  HONEY lis (liss-). In a far earlier source, reproduced in LT1:262, the word for "honey" was nektë. This would however become nehtë in LotR-style Quenya, since Tolkien later decided that kt becomes ht in Quenya, and in its new form nehtë the word turns up in the Etymologies with the slightly modified meaning "honeycomb". (Note: a homophone means "spear-head, gore, wedge, narrow promontory".) HONEY-BEE nier, nion –LIS, LT1:262, VT45:38, GL:60
  HOOD telmë (covering) –TEL
  HOOK ampa, atsa (claw, catch); HOOKED rempa (crooked) –LotR:1157/VT47:20, GAT, REP
  HOPE (noun) estel –WJ:318 (where it is stated that this word was used in Quenya as well as in Sindarin. Here the word is defined as "'hope', sc. a temper of mind, steady, fixed in purpose, and difficult to dissuade and unlikely to fall into despair or abandon its purpose". In MR:320, estel is translated "trust".)  
  HORDE horma (host) –LT2:341 
  HORN rassë, rasco ("especially on living animal, but also applied to mountains". Cf. Rasmund "horned bull" in Letters:423 [this seems like Sindarin rather than Quenya] and Arfanyaras, Arfanyarassë "high white-shining peak [*horn]", alternative name of Taniquetil), romba (so in Etym and one place in WJ [p. 400: romba = "horn, trumpet"] but on p. 368 róma is used for "horn", though this is glossed "trumpet-sound" in Etym), HORN OF ULMO hyalma (shell, conch), tildë (point), (horn of animal:) tarca (probably obsoleting taru in LT2); HORNED tarucca (perhaps obsoleted together with taru), THE HORNED Tilion (a name of the Moon) –RAS/VT46:10, WJ:403/416, ROM/WJ:401 contrast 368, SYAL, TIL, TARÁK, LT2:337,347, Silm:438
  HORRIBLE norta –VT46:4
  HORROR norto (glossed "a horror").The verb rucin is glossed "I feel fear or horror" (1st pers. aorist), constructed with "from" of the object feared (e.g. *rucin Orcollon "I fear Orcs") –VT46:4, WJ:415
  HORSE rocco (defined as "swift horse for riding" in Letters:382, "swift horse" in VT46:12), olombo (but since Tolkien subsequently changed the relevant stem from LOB to LOP, we should perhaps read *olompo, compare lopo in an earlier source), mairo; HORSEMAN roquen (rider, knight) –ROK/Letters:282, 382, VT45:28, PE16:132, GL:56, WJ:372/UT:282
  HOST rimbë (crowd), horma (horde), liyúmë –RIM/Letters:178, 382, LT2:341, VT48:32
  HOSTILE cotya –KOT
  HOT saiwa; BLAZING HOT úrin (Úrin is also a name of the Sun) –LT1:248/265, LT1:271
  HOUND huan (hún-); HOUND OF CHASE ronyo –KHUG (see KHUGAN), ROY
  HOUR lúmë (so translated in LotR and in VT43:34; in Etym the gloss is simply "time". Allative lúmenna is attested. Note: lúmë also means "darkness".) THIS HOUR #sillumë (isolated from the ablative sillumello “from this hour”) –LU, LotR:94, WJ:367, VT44:35
  HOUSE coa (prob. the most neutral word), opelë (walled house), car (card-) (building), nossë (clan, family, kin, people) (LT2:336 gives indo "house" and os(t) "house and cottage"; these words are probably obsolete – in Tolkien's later Quenya indo means "heart", while osto means "city". The term indor "master of house" can hardly be valid either.) LIGHT OF THE HOUSE coacalina (a metaphor for the soul [fëa] dwelling inside the body [hroa]) –WJ:369/MR:250/VT47:35, PEL(ES), KAR, NŌ/LT1:250, 343, MR:250    
  HOW manen –PM:395
  HUE quilë (colour) –QL:77
  HUGE haura –PE17:115
  HUMAN firya (lit. *"mortal"; nominal pl. Firyar is attested) –PHIR, WJ:219
  HUMBLED nucumna –SD:246
  HUMP tumpo (stem *tumpu-), HUMPBACK cauco, HUMPED cauca (bent, crooked) –TUMPU, LT1:257
  HUNGRY maita –VT39:11
  HUNT (noun), HUNTING roimë (the misreading "raime" occurs in the Etymologies as printed in LR; see VT46:12 for this correction). No verb "to hunt" is given in Etym, but roita- "pursue" is derived from the same stem and can probably be translated *"hunt" as well. LT1:260 has rauta- "hunt". –ROY1 
  HURL, see FLING
  HURT (vb) mala- (pain) –QL:63
  HUSBAND venno (the published Etymologies gives "verno", but according to VT45:7, this is a misreading of Tolkien's original manuscript); HUSBAND AND WIFE veru (married pair – but in a late source, veru is also used for “husband” alone, the counterpart of veri “wife”) –BES, VT49:45
  HUSH quildë (rest, quiet) –GL:23
  HYACINTH (plant) linquë (Note: Homophones mean “wet” and also *“grass, reed”). –PE17:62
 	
  <I>
  I (1st pers. sg): This pronoun normally appears as the ending -n or -nyë (VT49:51) added to verbs, e.g. carin and carinyë “I do”, maruvan "I will abide". The long form -nye must be used if another pronominal ending is to be added after it: utúvienyes, "I [-nye-] have found it [-s]". Independent pronouns: ni (in the "Arctic" sentence, ni is translated "I"), stressed ní with long vowel (VT49:51), as in ní nauva tanomë “I will be there” (VT49:19; ní nauva puts more emphasis on “I” than nauvan, with the pronoun expressed as an ending). The dative pronoun nin "for me" is transparently ni + the dative ending -n; other case endings may also be added to ni. It may be that ni, ní can also function as object (“me”), though a distinct form nye has also been proposed. The longer pronoun inyë may also be used where “I” is emphatic, and presumably can also take case endings. –VT49:48, 50, LotR:1008/1003, Arct, LR:61
  ICE helcë; ICE-COLD helca (the final –a is missing in the printed Etymologies, entry KHEL, but VT45:21 confirms that this is a typo; the full form also occurs in LT1:254 and Silm) –LT1:254/Silm:433/KHEL
  IDEA intya (guess, supposition), inca (cited with a final hyphen in the source, but it does not seem to be a verbal stem); *selma (Þ) ("a fixed idea, will". In WJ:319, the word is given as Þelma, but Þ (th) would become s in the Noldorin Quenya. Cf. Þindë, sindë in WJ:384; see GREY) –INK, VT45:18, WJ:319
  IDENTICAL imya (same, selfsame) –VT47:37
  IDOL cordon –LT1:257
  IDRIL Itaril, Itarillë, Itarildë (obsoleting Irildë in LT2) –PM:346/Silm:436, LT2:343
  IF qui (in some texts cé or ce, but the latter form Tolkien defined as “may be” elsewhere); IF ANYBODY aiquen (whoever). IF IT BE SO cenasit, cenasit (may be, perhaps), IF IT BE THAT cenai (but this word probably presupposes cé, ce rather than qui, as the word for “if”).  –VT49:19, PE14:59, WJ:372
  ILL laiwa (sick, sickly). Since this is derived from a root in sl-, the spelling *hlaiwa may fit Tolkien's later system better: he derived Quenya forms in hl- from roots with this initial combination. (For noun “illness”, see SICKNESS under SICK.) BE ILL quama- (vomit) –SLIW, QL:76
  ILL-SHAPEN nauca (hard, twisted, *small – see SMALL.) –WJ:413
  ILLUMINATE calya- –KAL
  IMAGINATION síma (mind), alternative form (?) isima; also nausë (Þ) –VT49:16, NOWO
  IMMINENT – BE IMMINENT: úva- (impend), nearly always in a bad sense: threaten to come. Hrívë úva vena “winter is drawing near to us”. –VT49:14
  IMMORTAL ilfirin –PHIR       
  IMMOVEABLE tulca (firm, strong, steadfast; Note: there is a homophone meaning "fix, set up, establish") –TULUK cf. LT1:270
  IMPLEMENT (prob. noun) yaima –GL:37
  IMPEDED tapta; nominal pl. taptar was used = tapta tengwi "impeded elements", a term for consonants (sg. #tapta tengwë; in the pl. we would rather expect *taptë tengwi with the pl. form of the adjective). –VT39:17
  IMPEND úva- (be imminent), nearly always in a bad sense: threaten to come. Hrívë úva véna “winter is drawing near to us”. –VT49:14
  IMPORTANT valdëa (of moment) –QL:102
  IMPOSSIBLE TO RECOUNT únyárima ("sc. because all the facts are not known, or the tale is too long"), IMPOSSIBLE TO SAY/PUT INTO WORDS úquétima (unpronounceable, unspeakable), A THING IMPOSSIBLE TO BE OR TO BE DONE únat –WJ:370, VT39:26
  IMPULSE felmë (emotion), hórë; BODY-IMPULSE hroafelmë (impulses provided by the body, e.g. physical fear, hunger, thirst, sexual desire), SPIRIT-IMPULSE fëafelmë (impulses originating with the spirit, e.g. love, pity, anger, hate); IMPULSIVE hórëa (the gloss "impulsion" in the printed Etymologies is a misreading, VT45:22); HAVE AN IMPULSE horya- (be compelled to do something, set vigorously out to do) –KHOR, VT41:19 cf. 13, VT45:22
  IN mi (within), imi; IN THE mí (for *mi i?) (The version of Nam in LotR has mi where the version in RGEO has the more correct form mí.) IN or AT: sé, se (the form with a long vowel may be preferred since se is apparently also a 3rd person pronoun) This preposition sé is apparently related to the locative ending -ssë (plural –ssen, dual –tsë) that would be the most typical way of expressing "in, on, at" in Quenya. IN, INWARDS, see separate entry INWARDS. –MI, VT43:30/VT44:18, 34, Nam, RGEO:66, VT43:30, 34
  IN- (prefix denying presence or possession of thing or quality) ú- (not-, un-) –VT39:14; according to LR:396 s.v. UGU, this prefix usually has a "bad sense", cf. vanimor "fair folk" vs. úvanimor "monsters".
  INADEQUATE penya (pl. penyë is attested) (lacking). INADEQUATE SIGN #penya tengwe (only pl. penyë tengwi is attested). This term, also translated "lacking signs", was used in early Elvish analysis of Quenya as the term for vowels with no preceding consonant, held (in many cases incorrectly) to have lost such a consonant. –VT39:6, 8
  IN A VERY GREAT NUMBER úvëa (abundant) –UB
  IN FRONT OF (of spatial relationships) opo, pó (before) –VT49:12
  INCARNATE (noun) #mirroanwë (only pl. mirroanwi "incarnates" is attested) –MR:350

  INCLINED penda (sloping down) –PEN
  INDEED (interjection) é. Can be prefixed to sentences, as in e man antaváro? "What will he give indeed?" (LR:63); this e would seem to be a short variant of é. –VT45:11, LR:63
  INDEX FINGER (first finger) lepetas (evidently lepetass-), also tassa. This finger is also called emmë, emya (terms used in children's play, basically "mother, mummy"; also used = "index toe"). –VT47:10, 26, VT48:5
  INDEX TOE, see INDEX FINGER
  INDICATE tana- (show) (Note: tana also means "that"), tëa- (note: not to be confused with the noun tëa "straight line, road"), pa.t. tengë (VT43:38). INDICATION tengwë (sign, token, writing – pl tengwi is attested) INDICATED (adj) tengë. –MR:385, VT39:6, WJ:394, 395 cf. TEK, VT39:6
   INDIVIDUAL nassë (person) –VT49:30
  INDUCE sahta- (Þ) (referring primarily to inducing someone to do something against their will or conscience). –VT43:22

  INUNDATE oloiya- (flood) –VT42:10
  INVENT auta- (devise, originate) (Note: a homophone means "pass"); INVENTION aulë 
-GAWA 
  INWARDS – a word imbë said to be the adverb "in(wards)" appears in VT45:18 (not clearly identified as a Quenya word), but in LotR, imbë (imbi) is the preposition "between".
  INZILADÛN Palantir –UT:223, Silm:324
  IRELAND Íverind- (As indicated by the hyphen, some ending is needed – a Quenya word cannot end in nd. The normal form must be *Íverin, becoming Íverind(e)- before an ending, e.g. genitive *Íverindo, locative *Íverindessë [cf. Lórien, locative Lóriendessë]. The name is also given as Íwerin or Iverindor, "an island off the west coast of Tol Eressëa" – Eressëa later becoming England in this early version of Tolkien's mythology.) –LT2:344, cf 285

  ISLAND, ISLE lóna, tol (stem toll- as in the pl tolli; the plural was misread as "tolle" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, see VT46:19). According to Silm:438, tol is used of islands "rising with sheer sides from the sea or from a river". LT1:269 defines a tol as "any rise standing alone in water, plain of green, etc.") STEEP ISLE tollë (apparently simply the fuller form of tol). THE LONELY ISLE Tol Eressëa (tol "isle" often being omitted) –LONO, TOL/VT46:19/VT47:13, 26, RGEO:70
  ISOLATED ROUND HILL tolmen (boss of shield) –LT1:269
  ISOLATED TOWER mindo –MINI
  ISOLATED TREE ornë –ÓR-NI- (see ORO)
  ISSUE uswë (escape) –LT1:251
  ISSUE OF WATER ehtelë (fountain, spring) –KEL
  ISTHMUS yanwë (bridge, joining) –YAT
  IT (impersonal 3rd sg. pronoun – notice that “personal” forms are used of all living things including plants; see HE): As a pronominal suffix, the entire 3rd person singular “he, she it” is expressed by the ending -s , e.g. caris *“(s)he/it does” (VT49:16). The ending -s is also attested in object position, e.g. utúvienyes, "I have found [utúvienye-] it [-s]"). “It”, with reference to non-living or abstract things, does have a distinct form when appearing as an independent pronoun: sa (VT49:37), with long vowel (sá, VT49:51) when stressed. It is attested in object position: carë sa, “to do it” (VT49:34). Another word for “it” or “that” is ta (though in some sources, Tolkien used ta for plural impersonal “they, them” instead). Case endings may probably be added to sa, e.g. dative *san “for it” (cf. nin “for me”); sa also appears suffixed to a preposition in the word ósa *”with it” (VT43:29). Genitive ITS would normally appear as the ending -rya (only attested with personal meanings “his, her” – see HIS). “Its” as an independent word may be *sanya, formed from *san as the dative form of sa “it” (compare ninya “my” vs. ni “I”, dative nin “for me”). –VT49:16, 51, VT43:29, LotR:1008, TA
  ITSELF (reflexive pronoun used on non-living things) imma (also used as noun "same thing"); also in the form insa. –VT47:37

   JAIL see GAOL      
   JANUARY Narvinyë (In LT1:252, the word for January is avestalis, and the latter part of the month is called Erintion, but these words are hardly conceptually valid in LotR-style Quenya.) –LotR:1144
   JAW anca (translated "jaws" in the appendices to LotR and Silm, but anca is sg and is glossed "jaw" in Etym. GL:37 has cá [spelt "kâ"]) –LotR:1157, Silm:427, ÁNAK
  JERK (vb) rihta- (give quick twist or move), (noun:) rinca (twitch, trick, sudden move) –RIK(H), VT46:11 cf. RIK(H)
  JESUS Yésus –VT43:31
  JEWEL mírë (pl. míri is attested); SHINING JEWEL miril (treasure, precious thing). *NOLDO-JEWEL (= Silmaril) Noldomírë, Noldomír; WITH ADORNMENT OF RED JEWELS carnimírië (a pl form? Sg *carnimírëa? Letters:224 has carne- instead of carni-.) JEWEL OF YAVANNA yavannamírë (a fragrant evergreen tree with scarlet fruit, brought to Númenor by the Eldar) –MIR/Silm:434, Nam, ÑGOL/VT46:3, LotR:505 cf. Letters:224, UT:472
  JOIN: The intransitive verb verya- + allative is suggested to mean “be joined to”; this is also the idiom for “get married to” (see MARRY). JOINING (noun) yanwë (isthmus, bridge) –YAT, also VT45:45 (where the stem is given as YAN rather than YAT), VT45:46
  JOURNEY (noun) lenda –PE17:60
  JOY alassë (merriment) –GALÁS
  JUDGE (vb) #nam- (1st person aorist namin "I judge" in VT41:13). An alternative form #nav- occurs in navilwë "we judge" –VT42:34, VT48:11
  JUDGE (noun) Námo (Ordainer – the name of a Vala. In MR:150, though, Námo is glossed JUDGEMENT [of what is]). Note: a homophone námo means "person". –Silm:411
  JUDGEMENT námië – defined as "a (single) judgement" or "a (single) desire". A JUDGEMENT náma (desire). JUDGEMENT (of what is) Námo (but this is elsewhere glossed "Ordainer", and the ending -o normally does indicate something animate/masculine rather than something abstract). –VT41:13, MR:150

  JULY Cermië –LotR:1144
  JUNE Nárië –LotR:1144
  JUMP cap- (pa.t. campë) (leap) –QL:45 cf. PE16:134
  JUPITER Alcarinquë (Basic Quenya:24, cf. Silm:55. According to LT1:260, Morwen (there translated "daughter of the dark") is a name of Jupiter, but this may not be a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya. LT1:265 also mentions Silindo as a name of this planet.
  JUST faila (fair-minded, generous) –PM:352
  
  <K>
  KEEN laica (the printed Etymologies has a final –e instead of –a, but this is a misreading; see VT45:25) (sharp, acute, *piercing); KEENNESS (of perception) laicë (acuteness). The conceptual validity of these words is questionable; see PIERCING. –LAIK

  KINDLE tinta- (cause to sparkle), narta-; in older [TLT] materiel also turu-, tunda- (Note: there is a homophone meaning "tall") –Silm:438, VT45:37, LT1:270
  KINDLY asëa (Þ) (beneficial, helpful) (so according to a late note where the word is derived from *ATHAYA). Also (as noun) used as the name of the healing plant called in Sindarin athelas.
  KING aran (pl arani is attested) In Etym, the Quenya word for "king, chieftain" is haran pl. harni, but evidence from LotR, WJ and UT shows that Tolkien changed it to aran pl arani. Cf. asëa aranion "kingsfoil", i arani Eldaron "the Kings of the Eldar", Arandor "kingsland", aranya *"my king", arandil "king's friend, royalist", and arandur "king's servant, minister".) LT1:273 has vardar "king", but this is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. KINGLY BULL Aramund (this may not be pure Quenya, because of the final consonant cluster) –3AR, LotR:899, WJ:369, UT:165, 193, 313, Letters:386, 423
  KINGDOM #aranië (attested with the suffix –lya "thy" added). Earlier versions of the text in question had other forms: #turinasta, #turindië (both also occurring with a long ú). –VT43:12, 15

  KNOLL nóla –NDOL
  KNOT narda, nútë (bond). Pl. perhaps *núter not *núti; cf. the similar formation tyávë "taste", pl tyáver. –SNAR, NU
  KNOW ista (pa.t. sintë, also isintë; according to VT48:25 the pa.t. is "certainly irreg."), KNOW ABOUT hanya- (understand, be skilled in dealing with), KNOWLEDGE handë (understanding), ista, istya, issë (lore), nólë (long study, lore, wisdom). (In Etym this word is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. Nólë is so spelt also in Silm:432. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) HAVING KNOWLEDGE istima (wise, learned) –IS, VT48:25, LT2:339; KHAN, ÑGOL, Silm:432

  LABOUR (vb) móta- (toil), moia- (be afflicted) –MŌ, VT43:31
  LACKING (adj.) penya (pl. penyë is attested) (inadequate). LACKING SIGN #penya tengwe (only pl. penyë tengwi is attested). This term, also translated "indadequate signs", was used in early Elvish analysis of Quenya as the term for vowels with no preceding consonant, held (in many cases incorrectly) to have lost such a consonant. –VT39:6, 8
  LADY heri –KHER, LT1:272 (GL:45 has quimellë). A quite different word which Tolkien also translated "Lady" is massánië, literally "breadgiver", the title of the "Lady" or the highest among the elven-women of any people, she having the right to keep or give away lembas bread. See PM:404.
  LAKE ailin (pool) (LT2:339 also has ailo), ringwë (cold lake, pool [in mountains]). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, this word is cited as "ringe", but according to VT46:11, ringwë is the proper reading. –AY/LT2:339, RINGI/VT46:11
  LAMENT (vb) naina- (also longer nainaina-), nyéna-; LAMENT (noun) nainië, nairë –NAY/VT45:37, LT1:262, RGEO:66

  LAND nórë (dwelling-place, race, country, region where certain people live, nation, native land, family), nór (meaning '"'land' as opposed to water or sea", WJ:413). In compounds #-ndor (when the first part of the compound end in a vowel, e.g. Valandor "Vala-land", alternative form of Valinor), or –nor, –dor (the latter can only occur when the first part of the compound ends in –l, –r, or –n; in other combinations d cannot occur in Noldorin Quenya). Another ending occurring in the names of lands is -sta (see VT43:15).  Cf. also lóna (remote land difficult to reach, island. Note: a homophone means "dark"); WESTLAND Númenor, Númenórë (Westernesse); LAND OF GIFT (a name of Númenor) Andor (< *Annandor, see GIFT), LAND OF THE WEST Númendor, LAND OF THE VALAR Valinor, Valinórë.  –NDOR/NŌ/Silm:430/ WJ:413, LONO, Silm:414, 313, 430, VT49:26
  LANGUAGE quetil (tongue, talk), lambë (tongue). The latter was "the usual word, in non-technical use, for 'language'." (WJ:394) Only the Loremasters used the technical term tengwesta "system or code of signs" instead; this word is also glossed "grammar". Notice that lambë is also used for "dialect" (VT39:15). LANGUAGE (as an abstract, the ability to speak or the "art" of making speech) tengwestië. LANGUAGE with especial reference to phonology: Lambelë. LANGUAGE OF THE VALAR Lambë Valarinwa (lit. *"Valarin language"), LANGUAGE OF THE ELDAR Eldarissa (the latter may not be a valid word in LotR-style Quenya), LANGUAGE OF THE HANDS mátengwië –KWET/VT45:25, WJ:394, 397, VT39:15, LT2:339, VT47:9
  LARCH finë (stem *fini-) –SPIN (the word is also glossed "a single hair", PM:362)
  LARGE hoa (big), also alta, alat- (great in size) (Tolkien's definition of alta word was actually illegible, but see GREAT), úvëa (very large, abundant, in a very great number), úra (note: a homophone means "nasty, evil"; some would say these later glosses render the word úra = "large" obsolete.) –PE17:115, ÁLAT, UB, UR

  LAST (adj.) tella (hindmost), telda (final), métima (final, ultimate), telwa (late), LAST YEAR yenya; LAST DAY OF YEAR quantien, THE LAST-COMERS Teleri (the Hindmost) –TELES, WJ:411, MC:222 cf. 215, LT1:267, YEN, Silm:421

  LATE telwa (last) –LT1:267
  LAUGH lala- –PM:359 cf. 343. (Note: a homophone means "deny".) Past tense perhaps *landë, given the derivation stated (whereas lala "deny" might have the past tense *lalanë or *lallë). 
  LAW sanyë (Þ) (rule), axan (rule, commandment, as proceeding primarily from Eru; pl. axani is attested); LAW-ABIDING sanya (Þ) (normal, regular) (variant vorosanya with a prefixed element meaning "ever"). –STAN, WJ:399, VT39:30, 23, VT46:16
  LAWN palis (sward) –LT1:264

LEAF-SHAPED lassecanta; LEAF-FALL lasselanta (autumn or the beginning of winter; see also FADING); LEAF-GREY lassemista –LAS1, Nam, VT39:9, LT1:254, MC:222, 223, Letters:282, LT1:258, KAT, LotR:505 cf. Letters:224
  LEAGUE lár (basic meaning "pause" – in marches a brief halt was made for each league). A lár was defined as five thousand rangar; see YARD. A ranga was approximately 38 inches, so a lár was "5277 yards, two feet and four inches [ca. 4826 meters], supposing the equivalence to be exact" – close enough to our league of 5280 yards to justify this translation. –UT:285
  LEANING talta (sloping, tilted) –TALÁT
  LEAP cap- (jump); halta-; LEAPING (noun) haloitë (pl. haloisi is attested) –PE16:134, LT1:254

  LEARNED istima (wise, having knowledge), nóla (wise).  (In Etym, the latter word is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. Cf. also the spelling of the related word nólë in Silm:432. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) LEARNED MAN istyar (scholar) –IS, ÑGOL
  LEATHER (dressed leather) alu –QL:30
  LEAVE (vb) auta- (go away, pass), pa.t. oantë, oantië (in the physical sense "went away [to another place]") or vánë ("the most frequently used past [tense]" – less "physical" than oantë, meaning "disappeared" rather than "went away"), perf. avánië (pl avánier is attested); perf. vánië with no augment may occur in verse. For "leave", Etym also has lesta, pa.t. lendë; this is also the past tense of "go". The stem from which lesta- is derived was "replaced" by another. Lesta has a wholly different meaning in later writings; see GIRDLE, MEASURE. LEAVE OUT hehta- (pa.t. hehtanë is given but seems perfectly regular) (put aside, exclude, abandon, forsake) –WJ:366, ELED
  LEAVE (noun) – with leave of: lenémë (+ genitive)

  LENGTHENED taina (extended, stretched, elongated); LENGTHENING tailë (extension) –TAY cf. VT39:7
  LESS mis (adverb); suffix –LESS –lóra (= "without"; this –lóra is a suffix used to derive adjectives; Tolkien gave the example ómalóra "voiceless"). The earlier "Qenya" suffix –viltë, –valta of similar meaning may not be valid in LotR-style Quenya. –PE14:80, VT45:28, GL:23
  LESSEN píca (part. #pícala is attested) (dwindle) –MC:223, 222
  LET (see ALLOW); LET GO lerya (release, set free), LET GO or LET LOOSE sen- (to free). LET IT BE THAT nái (in Namárië: nai; the editor conjectures that nái is an etymological form, VT49:36). –VT41:5, 6; VT43:18, VT49:28
  LETTER tengwa (pl. tengwar is attested; this word was used primarily of the Fëanorian letters. However, the term "Tengwar of Rúmil" occurring in LotR:1151 seems to indicate that the word tengwa can indeed be used of a letter of any kind, not only the Fëanorian letters. In non-technical use tengwa may also be translated "consonant" [q.v.]. It is uncertain whether tengwa "letter" can be used in the sense mail, text sent in the post; the primary meaning is clearly "character, a single symbol in writing".) The noun tengwa is also the source of the verb tengwa- “read”. – Another word for “letter” is sarat (pl. sarati is attested) – an older [MET] word Tolkien notes was used of "a 'letter' or any individual significant mark", used of the Rúmilian letters after the invention of the Fëanorian Tengwar (but cf. the term "Tengwar of Rúmil" mentioned above). –TEK, WJ:396, VT49:48, LotR:1151

  LIE (1) (vb, not "tell a lie" but "lie [horisontally]") caita- (pa.t. #cainë with the alternative cëantë); LIE HEAVY lumna- (Note: this is also an adjective meaning "lying heavy"; see OPPRESSIVE) –Nam/RGEO:67, VT48:12, 13, DUB
  LIE (2) (vb, tell a lie) fur- (conceal) (read perhaps *hur- since Tolkien decided that fu- becomes *hu- in Quenya) –LT2:340
  LIFE #coivië (attested with a pronominal suffix: coivierya, “his/her life”), cuilë (being alive; obsoleting coi, coirë in LT1:257; the latter means "stirring, spring" in Tolkien's later Quenya); NEW LIFE laito, laisi (vigour, youth), LIFE-BREAD coimas (prob. coimast[a]-, cf. masta "bread") (lembas) –VT49:41,:42, KUY, LT1:267, Silm:406/429

  LIKE (vb): “I like it” can be paraphrased as nas mara nin, “it is good to me” (good from my perspective) (VT49:30). The idiom thus involves the verb “to be” + mara (read mára) “good” + a dative form representing what in English is the subject.
  LIKE (prep) ve (as) The expression “like that” (= “so, also”) may be translated ta as in ta mára “so good” –Nam/RGEO:66, 67, VT49:12

  LOFTY tára (tall, high); compare antara "very lofty". Also arta (exalted, noble; note that homophones mean "athwart" and also "fort"). (According to Letters:282, Varda means "Lofty" [WJ:402 has "the Sublime"], but this word should probably not be used as a common adjective.) LOFTY TOWER see TOWER. –TĀ/Silm:437/LT1:264, VT45:36, VT46:17, PM:354

(These forms may obsolete nólemë in LT1:263. In some sources, nólë and nolwë are spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. Cf. also the spelling of the related word nólë in Silm:432. But if these words are written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) LOREMASTER ingolmo (In Lambengolmor "Loremasters of Tongues" the initial i of ingolmo [pl ingolmor] has disappeared; perhaps #ngolmo is the form used in compounds when the first part of the compound ends in a vowel.) –ÑGOL, LT2:339, WJ:382, WJ:383/396
  LOST vanwa (gone, departed, vanished, past and over, no longer to be had, dead); ONE LOST OR FORSAKEN BY FRIENDS hecil (gender-spesific forms are hecilo m. and hecilë f.) (waif, outcast, outlaw) –WAN, Nam, WJ:366, 365
  LOT marto (fortune, fate) –LT2:348
  LOUD SOUND róma (trumpet-sound) (Note: in early “Qenya”, róma also means "shoulder".) MUSICAL SOUND lin (stem lind-) (melody) –ROM, LotR:488 cf. Letters:308        
  LOVE (vb, love as friend) mel- (melinyes and melin sé “I love him”, VT49:15, 21). LOVE (noun) melmë (LT1:262 has meles, melessë); LOVELY melwa, LOVING nilda (friendly), méla (affectionate), BELOVED melda (dear, sweet), LOVER meldo (pl meldor is attested), melindo (m.), melissë (f.); LOVEABLE melima (fair), írima (desirable) –MEL, LT1:262, WJ:412, NIL, VT39:11, ID   
  LOW, LOWLYING tumna (deep, profound, dark or hidden); LOWER AIR vilma (earlier [MET] wilma), Aiwenor (lit. "Birdland"). LOWTIDE nanwë (ebb) –TUB cf. LT1:271, WIL, AIWĒ, VT48:26
  LOWER (vb) luvu- (brood); DARK LOWERING CLOUD lumbo (pl. lumbor is attested). –LT1:259 
  LOWLY (adj.) nalda (also = valley, as adj.) –QL:66
  LUCK valto (LT2:348 gives mart "a piece of luck", but word-final rt does not occur in LotR-style Quenya. Read *martë or something similar?) –LT1:272, LT2:348
  LUMP tolos (knob) –LT1:269
  LUNAR MONTH ránasta –VT48:11
  LUST mailë; LUSTFUL mailëa –MIL-IK
  LYING HEAVY lumna (heavy, burdensome, oppressive, ominous) Combined with the superlative prefix an-, this word should appear as *andumna because d was the initial sound of the original root. (Note: lumna is also a verb meaning "lie heavy"); LYING IN BED caila (bedridden, ?sickness) –DUB, KAY/VT45:19
  LYRE salma –LT1:265

  <M>
  MAEDHROS Nelyafinwë (meaning "Finwë third", not equivalent in sense to Sindarin Maedhros. The short form of the name was Nelyo. His mother-name [q.v.], "recorded....though never used in narrative", was Maitimo "well-shaped one". He also had a nickname Russandol "copper-top") –PM:352, 353
  MAGIC †ingolë (deep lore). In LT1:269, curu is glossed "magic, wizardry", but in Etym the gloss is simply "skill". MAGIC (adj.) sairina –ÑGOL, GL:72
  MAGLOR Canafinwë, short form Cáno (not equivalent in sense to his Sindarin name, which is the cognate of his "mother-name" Macalaurë, "recorded...though never used in narrative"). –PM:352, 353
  MAID, MAIDEN wendë, vendë (the latter is the Exilic Quenya form), also short form wen with stem wend- as in pl. wendi (girl) (read v- for w- in Exilic Quenya). Tolkien also used the word wendë (variants vénë, véndë, read evidently vendë) to translate "virgin" in his Quenya version of a Catholic prayer, where the reference is to the Virgin Mary. According to VT47:17, this term can be used of a "maiden" of any age up to fully adult (until marriage). In compounds –wen, e.g. Nerwen "Man-maiden" (probably with stem *-wend-). MAIDENHOOD wendelë (Exilic Quenya *vendelë). –WEN, LT1:271/273/Silm:439, VT44:10, 18, VT47:17
  *MAIDENLY (or *VIRGINAL) *vénëa (only attested in elided form vénë') –VT44:10
  MAKE #car- (1st pers. aorist carin "I make, build". The same verb is translated "form" in WJ:391: i carir quettar, "those who form words". According to Etym the past tense is carnë, though FS and SD:246 have cárë. Past participle #carna *"made" is attested in Vincarna *"newly-made" in MR:305; the longer participial form carina occurs in VT43:15, read probably *cárina with a long vowel to go with such late participial forms like rácina "broken"). MAKING carmë (glossed "art" in UT:396 and is also translated "production", but cf. the following:) NAME-MAKING Essecarmë (an Eldarin seremony in which the father of a child announces its name.) MAKE FAST avalerya- (bind, restrain, deprive of liberty). TO (MAKE) FIT camta- (sic; the cluster mt seems unusual for Quenya, and while the source does not explicitly say that this word is Quenya, it is difficult to understand what other language could be intended) (suit, accomodate, adapt). MAKE FOR IT mína- (desire to go in some direction, to wish to go to a place, have some end in view). –KAR, WJ:391, MR:214, VT41:5, 6, VT44:14, VT39:11
  MALE (noun) hanu (man, male of Men/Elves or animals); MALE (adj) hanwa –3AN, VT45:16, INI
  MAN nér (ner-; pl. neri given) (#ner as the final element in compounds, as in vëaner and úner, see below), †vëo (-wë as final element in compounds); hanu (male); (ADULT) MAN vëaner; MANLY vëa (adult, vigorous); LARGE/STRONG MAN nerdo, SMALL MAN nercë (perhaps with stem nerci-) MANHOOD vië (vigour); MAN-SPEARHEAD (a wedge-formation of soldiers) nernehta, NOMAN úner (All these words can apparently be used of adult males of any sentient race. For "Men" in the sence "humans", see MORTALS, FOLLOWERS.) –DER, WEG (cf. VT46:21 indicating that †vëo should be marked as an archaic/poetic word), VT47:33, VT45:16, UT:282, UT:211   MANAGE mahta- (deal with, fight, handle, manage, wield, wield a weapon); pa.t. mahtanë is attested. –MAK/MA3/VT39:11, VT47:6, 18, 19, VT49:10
  MANNER lé (method). Note: lé can also be an emphatic pronoun “you”, plural. AFTER THE MANNER can be expressed by ve “as, like” + genitive, as in the phrase ve quenderinwë coaron “after the manner of bodies of Elven-kind” –PE17:74, 174
  MANTLE (vb.) fanta- (to cloak, veil) –VT43:22
  MANY limbë, also prefix lin- (by assimilation it becomes lil- before l, as in lillassëa "having many leaves"; before m, r, s it would similarly become *lim-, *lir-, *lis-). Instead of using the early "Qenya" form limbë for "many", it may be safer to use the later form rimba, by Tolkien glossed "numerous" (q.v. for reference). –LT2:342, LI, Plotz letter
  MAR #hasta- (verb stem isolated from the past participle hastaina, see below); MARRED hastaina (Arda Marred = Arda Hastaina); UNMARRED alahasta –MR:255, 254 
  MARBLE alas, alast- –QL:30, GL:39
  MARCH Súlimë –LotR:1144/Silm:437 (not capitalized in the latter source)
  MARINER ciryamo, (professional mariner:) ëarendur, Eärendilyon ("son of Eärendil [used of any mariner]", prob. *Eärendilyond-) –UT:8, Letters:386, LT1:250
  MARK (in writing) tehta (sign, diacritic) (In LotR:1155, this word is applied to the supralinear vowel-signs of Fëanorian writing, and pl tehtar is attested.) sarat (pl. sarati is attested), originally [MET] a word used of "a 'letter' or any individual significant mark", but after the invention of the Tengwar primarily used of the Rúmilian letters. TINY MARK tixë (dot, point) –TEK/VT39:17, TIK, WJ:396
  MARRY verya- (intransitive, with the person one marries in the allative case: veryanen senna *“I married him/her”, compare English “I got married to him/her”, though the Quenya phrase is also suggested to mean “I was joined to him/her”). The word verya- also means “dare”, but since this is transitive and would always be followed by a direct object, the two verbs can be distinguished. –VT49:45, 46
  MARS Carnil –Basic Quenya:24, cf. Silm:55
  MARY (Mother of Jesus) María –VT43:28, VT44:18 ("Maria" in VT44:12 lacks the accent, but this is probably a mere slip)
  MAST 1) (on ship) tyulma, 2) (fruit of beech) ferna (beechnuts) –TYUL/SD:419, PHER
  MASTER (noun) heru (pl. #heruvi, gen.pl. #heruion) (lord), #tur (cf. Fëanturi "Masters of Spirits", a name of the Valar Mandos and Irmo). MASTER OF DOOM Turambar, MASTER OF DESIRE Irmo (lit. "Desirer", the name of a Vala); MASTERY túrë (victory, strength, might); MASTERED #turúna (only the form turún`, with the final *-a elided, is attested. Silm:269 has turun instead of turún` – the accent and he elision mark seem to have been omitted.) –KHER, TUR/UT:438, Silm:261/269/423, 405, UT:138
  MATRIMONY vesta –BES
  MATTER (basic matter:) erma; PHYSICAL MATTER orma, hroa (the latter is also used = "body"). THAT MATTER tama; CONSIDERING A MATTER, see under C. –MR:338, 218, 216, VT49:11
  MAVWIN Mavoinë –LT2:345
  MAY (noun, the month) Lótessë (In LT1:252/254, the word for May is Kalainis, but this is hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya.) –LotR:1144
  MAY (verb): The impersonal verb ec- + dative can be used to express “may” in the sense of “have chance, opportunity or permission”: ecë nin carë sa “I can do that”, ecë nin? “please, may I?” (VT49:20). MAY as a verb “be allowed to” can be rendered by lerta-, to be able in the sense of being allowed (see BE ABLE): *Lertal carë ta, “you may (you are allowed) to do that”. MAY expressing uncertainty can be expressed by slipping in the particle cé: “He may have done that” = *cé acáries ta (maybe he has done that); see MAY BE. For MAY in wishes (may it happen, may it be), the word nai is used. It can directly precede an adjective (nai amanya onnalya “may your child [be] blessed”, VT49:41) or be constructed with a verb in the future tense (nai hiruvalyë Valimar *”may you find Valimar”, Nam) or the present tense (nai Eru lye mánata *“may God be blessing you”, VT49:41). 
  MAY BE (maybe) cé, ce (participle indicating uncertainty, like *“maybe, perhaps”), cenasit, cenasta –VT49:19, 27
  MAY IT BE SO, see AMEN
  ME: Certain Tolkien manuscripts supposedly provide nye as one word for “me” (compare tye “thee”). It may be, however, that in Tolkien’s later conception ni, ní “I” can also be used as object “me” (in late material it listed together with other pronouns that are attested both as subject and object, such as lye, sé and me, VT49:51). The ending -n, attested only as subject, may perhaps be employed following another pronominal ending: *Utúvielyen, "thou (-lye-) hast found me (-n)”. Case endings may be added to ni, e.g. dative nin "for me" (Nam). See I. 
  MEAD míruvórë (nectar, drink of the Valar) –NAM, RGEO:66, 69, LT1:261
  MEADOW – LT1:267 (GL:39) gives lairë, but this word already has two different meanings in Tolkien's later Quenya ("summer" and "poem"), so it is somewhat doubtful whether this word from Tolkien's earliest linguistic constructions remained conceptually valid at later stages.
  MEAL 1) (session of eating) mat (stem matt-). Also used = meal time. 2) (flour) porë (stem pori-) –QL:59, POR
  MEAN faica (contemptible) –SPAY
  MEANS – BY THIS MEANS, see SO
  MEASURE #lesta (only attested in instrumental form lestanen "in measure". Note: #lesta also means "girdle".) –FS

  MEN see MAN or MORTALS, FOLLOWERS
  MENTAL MESSAGE sanwë-menta (thought-sending) –VT41:5
  MERCURY (the planet, not the metal) Elemmírë –Basic Quenya:24
  MERCHILD oar (child of the sea), MERMAID oaris (oarits-), oarwen (prob. *oarwend-) (so in LT1:263 – read ëaris, ëarwen in Tolkien's later Quenya, since the word for "sea" was altered to ëar?)
  MERCY – HAVE MERCY órava- (+ locative to denote the object of the mercy; compare English "have mercy on [someone]; Tolkien expressed "have mercy on us" as órava messë) Another form, ócama or ocama, was possibly abandoned by Tolkien. –VT44:12-14
  MERRIMENT alassë (joy) –GALÁS
  MESSAGE menta (sending) –VT41:5
  MESH rembë –LotR:1149
  METAL tinco, rauta –TINKŌ/LotR:1157, RAUTĀ

  MEWING miulë (whining)
  MICKLEBURG Túrosto (Belegost) –WJ:389
  MIDDLE (noun) endë (core, centre); MIDDLE (prob. adj) enya, endya (In Noldorin Quenya, enya would be the natural form – endya looks like Vanyarin Quenya. Cf. the name of the language itself in the two dialects, Quenya vs. Quendya.) MIDDLE-DAY #enderë (only pl enderi is attested; for sg #enderë cf. yestarë, mettarë, the first and the last day of the year. The "middle-days" were three days inserted between the months of yávië and quellë in the Calendar of Imladris.) MIDDLE FINGER lependë, lepenel, in children's play also called tolyo or tollo ("sticker-up", also used of middle toe), yonyo ("son, big boy", again used of middle toe as well) or hanno ("brother"). –ÉNED, cf. WJ:361, LotR:1142, VT47:10, VT47:12, 14, VT48:6
  MIDDLE-EARTH Endórë, Endor (defined as "centre of the world" under ÉNED; allative form Endorenna is attested in LotR. Other names are also glossed "Middle-earth": Ambarenya, Endamar; see also EAST) –LotR:1003, ÉNED, MBAR
  MIGHT túrë (strength, victory, mastery) –QL:95
  MIGHTY taura, poldórëa (a title of Tulkas); MIGHTY-RISING Melkórë (> Melkor) (uprising of Power), THE MIGHTY Melko (an alternative form of Melkor, derived from an unattested adjective *melka, *melca "mighty", with connotations of violence.) –TUR, LT1:264/GL:64, MR:350
  MILCH COW yaxë. (An alternative form yaxi, glossed "cow", looks like a plural in LotR-style Quenya, unless it connects with the few other feminine forms in –i, like tári "queen".) –GL:36
  MIND sáma (pl. sámar is given), sanar (“thinker, reflector”), indo (heart, mood), (inner mind:) órë (heart) (Note: a homophone means "rising"), síma (imagination), also (?) isima. MIND-MOOD inwisti –VT39:23, VT41:13, MR:216, LotR:1157, VT49:16, MR:229

  MISERABLE angayanda, MISERY angayassë –QL:34, LT1:249
  MIST hísië (Þ), hísë (Þ) (stem hísi-) (fog. Note: a homophone means "dusk". For "mist" writers may prefer hísië, the form occurring in LotR.) –Nam/RGEO:67, KHIS
  MOAT see WALL AND MOAT
  MOCKING yaiwë (scorn) –YAY
  MOIST nítë (stem *níti-) (dewy) –NEI

  MONTH asta (pl astar is attested); this basically means "division, a part" (esp. one of other equal parts), here used of a division of the year. LUNAR MONTH ránasta –LotR:1142, VT48:11
  MOOD indo (heart, mind) –ID
  MOON Isil (-th-), Rána (so in Silm, VT47:11 and UT; Etym has Rana with a short a), CRESCENT MOON cú (bow), NEW MOON ceuran-, MOONLIGHT isilmë –I/THIL/LotR:1148, Silm:436/UT:242, RAN, LT1:271, VT48:7, MC:222, 223
  MORE ambë (adverb), amba (adjective/noun), “used of any kind of measurement spatial, temporal, or quantitative” (note that amba is also the adverb “up”). Early material lists lil as a term for “more”. ONE MORE enta (another). (Note: a homophone means "that yonder"). MOREOVER, FURTHERMORE, WHAT IS MORE entë, yëa, yé (Note: yé is also an interjection "lo! now see!") See FURTHERMORE. –PE17:91, PE14:80, VT47:15, 31

  MORN (early) artuilë, tuilë (the latter is also used in the sense "springtime") –TUY
  MORNING (noun) arin (LT1:254 gives cálë, but this word means "light" in later writings), MORNING (used as adj?) arinya (early) –AR1
  MORTAL fírima (pl. Fírimar is attested, lit. "those apt to die", WJ:387), also in the personal (masculine) form #fírimo (pl. fírimor, VT49:10, pl. allative fírimonnar "to mortals", VT44:35). The form firima with a short i occurs in VT46:4. Firya (pl. Firyar is attested); MORTAL MAN firë (pl firi is given but seems perfectly regular) –PHIR, WJ:387
  MOTH malo (2) (*malu-, pl. malwi). Note: a homophone means “pollen, yellow powder”. –QL:58
  MOTHER amillë, also short amil (probably with stem amill-), ammë (see also MUMMY). The form ontaril in VT43:32 and the variants #ontari, #ontarië in VT44:7, 18 seem to be more technical terms, etymologically *"female begetter". MY MOTHER emya (for em-nya, VT48:19). MOTHER-NAME (OF INSIGHT) #amilessë (tercenya) (i.e., names given by Elvish mothers to their children, indicating some dominant feature of the nature of the child as perceived by its mother. Only pl amilessi tercenyë is attested.) MOTHER OF GOD (Mary, in Tolkien's Quenya renderings of Catholic prayers) Eruamillë, Eruontari, Eruontarië –VT43:32, VT44:18-19, AM1, VT43:32, MR:217, VT43:32, VT44:7, 18
  MOUND coron, hahta (pile; the Sindarin cognate haudh is explicitly used of grave-mounds), cumbë (heap), tundo (stem *tundu-) (hill) –Sil:429, KHAG, KUB, TUN
  MOUNTAIN oron (#oront-, as in the pl. oronti) (oron also used = "mount", e.g. Oron Oiolossë "Mount Everwhite"), MOUNTAIN-PEAK aicassë; MOUNTAIN-TOP orotinga, orto; MOUNTAIN PASS falqua (cleft, ravine), MOUNTAIN-DWELLING (adj) orofarnë (pl? Sg *orofarna?) –ÓROT/WJ:403, AYAK, VT47:28, LT2:341, LotR:505 cf. Letters:224
  MOUTH anto, pé (but pé is glossed "lip" in a late source, see VT39:9), assa (hole, opening, perforation), náva ("ñ") (not only the lips but also the inside of the mouth – this word was apparently changed by Tolkien from páva), MOUTH OF RIVER etsir, WITH MOUTH FULL (= full to the brim) penquanta –LotR:1157, PEG, GAS, VT39:13 cf. 8, 19, ET, VT39:11
  MOVE (intransitive verb) lev-; also (of large and heavy things moving) rúma- (part. rúmala is attested) (shift, heave). SUDDEN MOVE (noun) rinca (twitch, jerk, trick) –PE16:132, MC:223, 222, VT46:11 cf. RIK(H)
  MUCH olya (adj.), olë (adv.) –PE14:80
  MUD luxo (luxu-) –QL:56
  MUMMY (affectionate form of "mother") emmë, emya (for emenya *"my mother"), also emil(inya) "(my) mother", said to be the terms a child would use to address his or her mother. (In UT:191 the form mamil occurs, used by a child but not in address.) The words emmë, emya were also used in children's play for "index finger" and "index toe" –VT47:10, 26, VT48:4
  MURK hui (fog, dark, night), MURKY huiva –LT1:253
  MURMUR nurru- (grumble) –MC:223
  MUSCLE tuo (sinew, strength) –TUG
  MUSIC lindalë (as in Ainulindalë "The Music of the Ainur"; LT1:258 has lindelë; the latter is also glossed "song". The form lindelë "music" also turns up in the printed Etymologies, entry LIN2, but according to VT45:27, this is a misreading for lindalë in Tolkien's manuscript.) –Silm:378, LIN2/VT45:27
  MY-nya (possessive suffix), e.g. meldonya "my friend" (VT49:40, 48), tyenya “my tye” (VT49:51, this is a term of address used to a dear kins(wo)man, literally “my thou”, with tye as an intimate 2nd person pronoun). An i seems to be inserted between the ending and the noun when the latter ends in a consonant: atarinya "my father" (LR:61). If the last consonant(s) of the noun is n or the cluster nd, a contracted form may be used in vocatives: hinya "my child" (for hínanya, WJ:403), yonya "my son" (for *yondonya, LR:61). – “My” as an independent word is apparently ninya, (derived from the dative form nin “for me”), though in FS it is used as a quasi-suffix (indo-ninya “my heart”).
  MYSELF (reflexive pronoun) immo (a general sg. reflexive pronoun, covering English "myself, him/herself, yourself"). A specific 1st person reflexive pronoun "myself" is imnë (for older imni; it is unclear whether the latter form was in use in later Quenya) –VT47:37

  <N>
  NAIL (noun) taxë (the kind of nail used to fasten something); NAIL (of the finger) nyelet, pl. nyelexi –TAK, PE15:75
  NAKED helda –SKEL
  NAME (noun) essë (pl. essi is attested, but see below concerning #esser as a possible alternative pl. form. Note: the word essë was also used in the sense "person as a whole", body and soul.) AFTER-NAME epessë (i.e., "a nickname – mostly given as a title of admiration or honour"); MOTHER-NAME (OF INSIGHT) #amilessë (tercenya) (i.e. names given by Elvish mothers to their children, indicating some dominant feature of the nature of the child as perceived by its mother. Only pl amilessi tercenyë is attested.) NAME OF INSIGHT #essë tercenya (i.e., the same as "mother-name"; only pl essi tercenyë is attested); GIVEN (OR ADDED) NAME anessë (pl anessi is attested. This term includes both "after-names" and "mother-names".) NAME-MAKING Essecarmë (an Eldarin seremony in which the father of a child announces its name), NAME-CHOOSING Essecilmë (an Eldarin seremony in which a person chooses a name according to his or her personal lámatyávë or sound-taste); SELF-NAME #cilmessë (only pl. cilmessi is attested, said to mean more literally "names of personal choice": #cilmë "choice" + essi "names". PM:339 explains that "some among the exiles gave themselves names, as disguises or in reference to their own deeds and personal history: such names were called kilmessi 'self-names'.") PLACE NAME #nómessë (isolated from the gen. pl. form nómesseron, "of place-names", VT42:17. This word suggests that the plural of essë can be esser as well as essi). –ES/LotR:1157/MR:216, UT:266, MR:217, 214, VT42:17
  NAME (verb) esta- –ES, VT45:12

  NIGHT lómë, ("Night, night-time, [shades of night]", in LT1:255 glossed "dusk, gloom, darkness"; according to SD:415, lómë has the stem-form lómi-), Fui, Hui ("Night" – but in LT1:253, hui is glossed "fog, dark, murk, night"), ló ("night, a night"), mórë (blackness, dark – obsoleting mori in LT1:260). In Valinorean usage, lómë "has no evil connotations; it is a word of peace and beauty and has none of the associations of fear and groping that, say, 'dark' has to us. For the evil sense I [sc. Tolkien's character Lowdham] do not know the [Quenya] word". For "night" in the "evil sense", mórë seems to be the best candidate. Yet lómë evidently developed darker connotations among the Exiles, for when crying auta i lómë "the night is passing" before the Nirnaeth Arnoediad, the Noldor used the word metaphorically to refer to the rule of Morgoth. DOOR OF NIGHT, see DOOR. –DO3, PHUY, SD:306, Silm:229 
  NIGHTINGALE lómelindë (pl lómelindi is attested; Etym also has morilindë), tindómerel ("daughter of twilight", a kenning of or a poetic name for the nightingale; the Sindarin equivalent is tinúviel. Tolkien changed the meaning of the final element from "daughter" to "child", see SEL-D-.) –DO3, Silm:64, MOR, TIN/Silm:422, 438

  NINETEEN neterquë. For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. –VT48:21
  NO ui, possibly with uito as an emphatic variant (VT49:28-29), lá (also meaning "not)". Ui (uito) and lá are probably used to deny facts, or what others present as facts. In a context of refusal, the interjection vá is to be preferred. It is derived from a stem that "expressed refusal to do what others might wish or urge, or prohibition of some action by others”. Cf also lala, lau, laumë "no, no indeed not, on the contrary; also used for asking incredulous questions". Prefixes "no-, un-": ú-, il-. SAY NO váquet- (forbid, refuse) (1st pers. sg aorist and past váquetin, váquenten are given), ava- (refuse) (pa.t. avanë is given; this verb was "little used in ordinary language". Other forms occur in VT49:13, all with the ending -n “I”: Aorist avan, present ávan or ávëan, future avuvan > auvan, past avanen or aunen, perfect avávien. In one version, the forms ávëan and avanen are marked as poetic or archaic.) –LA, WJ:371 cf. 370, GŪ/UGU/VT46:20, WJ:370, KWET
  NO LONGER TO BE HAD vanwa (gone, dead, departed, lost, past, vanished) –WJ:366
  NOBLE (adj.) arta (exalted, lofty; the gloss “noble” is isolated from the use of arta in certain proper names, see relevant entries in the Quenya-English wordlist). NOBLE (noun, “a noble”) arquen. The element #ar- in Arfanyarassë (a name of Taniquetil) is said to mean "high (i.e., noble, revered). Arquen is simply #ar "noble" + quen "person". NOBLE WOMAN (one of Galadriel's names) Artanis. –WJ:372, WJ:416, PM:347

  NOT lá (as for not- as a prefix = un-, see below). According to VT42:33, lá is the stressed form of the negation, whereas la is the unstressed form (cf. la- as the pretonic prefix *"not-" or *"un-", VT45:25). NO INDEED NOT lala; DON'T áva, avá; DON'T DO IT! áva carë!; I WILL NOT: vá (exclamation, also = Do not!); avan, ván, vanyë "I won't", avammë, vammë "we won't" (notice that if plural rather than dual, Tolkien later revised the ending for “we” from –mmë to –lmë); NOT COUNTING hequa (leaving aside, excluding, except), NOT COUNTED unotë, unotëa (read *únotë, *únotëa?)

ON BEHALF OF rá, followed by dative, as in the example rá men "on behalf of us, for us". Dative pronouns may be directly suffixed to rá: "for us" or "on behalf of us" is also attested in the one-word form rámen. (Note: rá is also a noun "lion".) ON THE CONTRARY úsië –VT43:27, 28, 33, VT49:8

  ONCE UPON A TIME yassë, yalúmessë, yáressë (note: the first of these seems to clash with *yassë "in/on which". Writers should use one of the two alternative forms, or the following:) andanéya, anda né (long ago) –YA, VT49:31
  ONE minë, min (obsoleting "Qenya" mir in LT1:260; a short variant min however appears in VT45:34, VT48:6), er (only, one, alone, but, still). A longer form of er, namely erëa, was possibly abandoned by Tolkien (VT44:17). Min, minë is "one" as the first of a series, whereas er is "one" in the context of something that is alone (Parma Eldalamberon #14, p. 82). When used in connection with a noun, er precedes it (VT49:45; according to this souce, er is indeclinable). ONE (= a person, someone) quén, quen- as in pl. queni (unstressed quen, "as a pronoun or final element in a compound"), also mo as an indefinite personal pronoun “one” or “somebody”, used in a sentence like “if one speaks evil…” (VT49:19, 20). THE ONE Eru (see GOD). For fractions ONE THIRD, ONE FOURTH etc., see entries for THIRD, FOURTH etc. –MINI, ERE/VT44:17, VT48:6, WJ:361 cf. 360, Silm:15, 431

  ORC (goblin) urco (stem urcu-, pl. urqui) or orco (pl. orqui or orcor, in the former case probably with stem *orcu- throughout). LT1:264 has orc, but word-final rc does not occur in LotR-style Quenya. Here the gloss is "monster, demon". Cf. WJ:390: "In the lore of the Blessed Realm the Q urko naturally seldom occurs, except in tales of the ancient days and the March, and then is vague in meaning, referring to anything that caused fear to the Elves, any dubious shape or shadow, or prowling creature." –ÓROK, LT1:264, WJ:390
  ORDAINER Námo (Judge – the name of a Vala) –Silm:411
  ORDER (noun) 1) (command) canwa (announcement); 2) (an “order” of people) heren (Heren Istarion "Order of Wizards"). For ORDER as a verb, see COMMAND; there is also the verb vala- (used of the Valar only, as in á vala Manwë "may Manwë order it", Valar valuvar "the will of the Valar will be done", *"the Valar will order [it]". –PM:362, UT:388, WJ:404

  OTHER exë (noun, glossed "the other", but the article may only indicate that this is a noun; likely there could be a distinction between exë "[an]other [one]" and *i exë "the other [one]"), exa (as adj., presumably behaving like other adjectives, e.g. *exa parma "[an]other book", *exë parmar "other books") Another adjective “other” is hyana, related to: OTHER PERSON hye, OTHER THING hya (the latter is also used as a conjunction “or”). –VT47:40, VT49:14, 15
  OUR: As described in the entry WE, the 3rd person pl. pronouns distinguish plural forms from dual (depending on whether two or more persons are involved) and exclusive forms from inclusive (depending on whether the party addressed is included in “we/our”). Tolkien revised the relevant endings repeatedly. According to one late resolution described in VT49:16, the endings for exclusive “our” are  –lma in the plural and –mma as a dual form, hence *aldalma “our tree” (with an “our” of at least three persons, not including the party addressed), but *aldamma “our tree = my and one other person’s tree”. The corresponding inclusive forms are –lwa (plural) and –ngwa (dual). Since the subject ending corresponding to the former is attested as “-lwe, –lve” (VT49:51), –lwa can surely also appear as *-lva, as in *omentielva “our meeting” (attested in the genitive case: omentielvo “of our meeting”, WJ:367). Hence *aldalwa/aldalva “our tree” (an “our” of at least three persons, including the party addressed), dual *aldangwa “our tree = thy and my tree”. – An independent word for plural exclusive "our" appears in VT43:19, 35: menya (also menyë modifying a plural noun). The corresponding plural inclusive form should apparently be *venya (pl. *venyë) for archaic *wenya (pl. wenyai > wenyë). The dual forms would most likely be *mentya (excl.) and *ventya (incl.); compare me, we/ve as the independent pronouns for “we” (with dual forms met, wet/*vet and dative forms *ment, * went/vent, from which the independent possessive pronouns are apparently derived by adding the adjectival ending -ya). – Notice that in an earlier conceptual phase, the forms in –mm- were plural (not as later dual) inclusive, and the forms in –lm- were plural inclusive rather than exclusive. This is why the word translated “of our meeting” appeared as omentielmo in the first edition of LotR, but was changed to omentielvo in the Second Edition. Cf. also Átaremma “our Father” as the first word of Tolkien’s translation of the Lord’s Prayer (VT43:12); this “our” is obviously meant to be plural exclusive rather than dual as it later became (according to Tolkien’s later conventions, “our Father” would be *Átarelma when a group of three or more persons addresses a party not included in “our”, in this case the Father himself).

  PARENT  #nostar (only pl nostari is attested); also ontar with gender-specific forms ontaro (m), ontarë or ontari (f) (begetter). The plural form "ontani" in LR:379 is according to VT46:7 a misreading for ontaru, evidently a dual form denoting a natural pair of parents. –LotR:1017 cf. Letters:308, ONO, VT44:7, VT46:7

  PASS (vb.) auta- (leave, go away); pa.t. oantë, oantië (in the physical sense "went away [to another place]", vánë ("the most frequently used past [tense]" – less "physical" than oantë, meaning *"disappeared" rather than "passed away"), also anwë (this pa.t. was "only found in archaic language"), perf. avánië (pl. avánier is attested); perf. vánië with no augment may occur in verse. –WJ:366; for the gloss "pass" see Silm:229

  PIERCING maica (sharp), terevë (fine, acute), laica (keen, sharp, acute). (The printed Etymologies has a final –e instead of –a, but according to VT45:25 this is a misreading. A word laike = laicë does appear in the source, but this is the noun corresponding to laica: "acuteness, keenness of perception". The conceptual validity of both laica and laicë with these meanings may however be questioned, since laica is the adjective "green" in later sources: laicë would then be expected to mean *"greenness".) FINE PIERCED HOLE terra –Silm:434, LT1:255, LT2:337, LAIK, VT46:18
  PIG polca; [?PIG-]FAT (the first part of the gloss is not certainly legible) larma (flesh). Note: #larma is used = “raiment” in a later source. –QL:75, VT45:26
  PILE (noun) hahta (mound) –KHAG
  PILLAR tarma, tulwë (standard, pole) –Silm:438, LT1:270
  PILLOW quesset (probably with stem *quessec- since the "Noldorin"/Sindarin cognate is given as pesseg, pointing to older *kwessek-). –KWES
  PIN tancil (brooch) –TAK
  PINETREE – GL:17 has aicassë, but in Etym this word is said to mean "mountain-peak".
  PINNACLE (topmost) see FINISH.
  PIPE simpa, simpina (flute), rotsë. PIPER simpetar, PIPING simpisë –LT1:266, LT2:347
  PIT latta (hole – Note: a homophone means "strap") –DAT
  PIVOT peltas (pl peltaxi) –PEL
  PLACE #nómë (isolated from nómesseron, compound "of place-names", VT42:17). In Etym the word for "place" is men, though this word would clash with the dative pronoun *men "to/for us"; #nómë may be preferred not only for clarity but also because it is apparently present in the LotR itself in the word sinomë "in this place" (Elendil's Oath); –nomë would be the compound form of nómë. It also occurs in tanomë “in the place (referred to)”. STONY PLACE sarnë (gloss misread as "strong place" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, see VT46:12). AT BACK OF PLACE, see BEHIND. Verb WISH TO GO TO A PLACE mína- (desire to go in some direction, make for it, have some end in view) –VT42:17, MEN, LotR:1003, SD:56, VT49:11, SAR, VT39:11
  PLAN pano (arrangement). Note: the word also means “piece of shaped wood”. –QL:72
 *PLANT #olva (only pl olvar is attested, never actually translated "plants" but defined as "growing things with roots in the earth"); LONG TRAILING PLANT uilë ("especially sea-weed", which is explicitly ëaruilë) –Silm:415, UY
  PLAY (vb) tyalin ("I play", 1st pers. aorist), PLAY (noun) tyalië (game, sport) –TYAL/LT1:260
  PLEDGE vanda (oath, solemn promise) –UT:317
  PLENITUDE fárë, farmë (all that is wanted, sufficiency) –PHAR/VT46:9
  PLIANT maxa (soft) –MASAG
  PLOUGH hyar; THE PLOUGH (constellation) see SICKLE OF THE VALAR. –LT2:342
  PLUM pio (also used for "cherry") –LT2:347
  POEM lairë (Note: a homophone means "summer"), lirit –GLIR, LT1:258
  POINT (verb): The phrase tentanë numenna, translated “pointed westward”, would indicate that the verb glossed DIRECT TOWARD (q.v.) can also be translated “point”. Tentanes formenna “it pointed northwards” –VT49:23, 26
  POINT (noun) mentë (end), tixë (dot, tiny mark), tildë (horn), variant tillë (tip) (also used of fingers and toes, VT47:10, 26; see UP-POINT, UNDER-POINT), amatixë (point/dot over the line of writing, variant amatexë in VT46:20), unutixë (point/dot under the line of writing; the initial element unu- was misread as "nun-" in the Etymologies as printed in LR, see VT46:19). SPEAR-POINT nasta (spear-head, gore, triangle). –MET, TIK/VT46:19, TIL/VT47:10, 26, SNAS/VT46:14
  POISON (noun) sangwa –SAG
  POLE tulwë (standard) –LT1:270
  POLISHED COPPER calarus (calarust-) –VT41:10
  POLLEN malo (stem *malu-) (yellow powder) Note: a homophone means “moth”. –SMAL
  POOL nendë, linya, ailin (lake), ringwë (cold lake). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the last word is cited as "ringe", but according to VT46:11, ringwë is the proper reading. DEEP POOL lón, lónë (pl. lóni given) (river-[?feeding] well), POOL OF LILIES nénuvar –NEN, LIN, AY, RINGI, VT48:28, LT1:248
  POPLAR-TREE tyulussë; HAVING MANY POPLARS lintyulussëa –TYUL, LIN
  POPPY fúmella (pl. fumellar [read *fúmellar?] is attested), fúmellot (prob. fúmellót-; cf. lótë "flower") –LT1:252
  PORTION, cf. DISTRIBUTE IN EVEN PORTIONS
  POSSESS harya-; POSSESSING arwa (+ genitive) (in control of) (Note: harya- is not used of one's offspring. In MR:228, Tolkien notes that "no Elf would speak of possessing children; he would say: 'three children have been added unto me', or 'are with me', or 'are in my house'.") –3AR
  POST (wooden post) samna (Þ) (Distinct from #samna "diphthong" in Tengwar spelling, as the latter is spelt with initial silmë, not súlë.) –STAB
  POTTER cemnaro, centano –KEM, TAN
  POUR ulya- (intransitive pa. t. ullë, transitive ulyanë; plural subjunctive ullier "should pour" is attested. These forms may obsolete ulu- and ulto- "pour" [transitive and intransitive] in LT1:270); POURING úlëa (flooding, flowing) –ULU, SD:310
  POUT penga- (VT39:11)
  POWDER (yellow powder) malo (stem *malu-) (pollen)  Note: a homophone means “moth”. –SMAL
  POWER: For "power" as an abstract, the word túrë "mastery, strength, might" may be used. The word Valar is sometimes translated "the Powers" (and the sg. vala is defined as "angelic power" in LotR Appendix E), but this word obviously has a specialized meaning: the "gods" of Tolkien's legendarium.
  PRAISE (vb) laita- (bless) (Imperative a laita and fut #laituva are attested, the latter with pronominal endings: laituvalmet, "we shall praise them") PRAISE (noun) #laitalë (isolated from Erulaitalë "Praise of Eru") –LotR:989 cf Letters:308, UT:436
  PRAY #hyam- (attested in the form hyamë, evidently incorporating the ending -ë of the aorist stem), arca- (the latter perhaps primarily in the sense "to petition", cf. the noun arcandë "petition"). –VT43:32, 33 (VT44:8, 18)
  PRAYER #cyermë (isolated from Erucyermë, "prayer to Eru". A verbal stem #cyer- "pray" can also be isolated, though it may be better to use attested verbs like #hyam- or arca-.) –UT:436
  PRECIOUS mirwa (valuable); PRECIOUS THING mírë (jewel, treasure, shining jewel) –PE17:37, MIR
  PRECIPICE (seaward) ollo (cliff) (The alternative form oldó may be archaic Quenya.) –LT1:252   PREPARE manwa- –QL:59
  PRESS (vb.) nir- (thrust, force [in a given direction]). ("Though applicable to the pressure of a person on others, by mind and 'will' as well as by physical strength, [this verb] could also be used of physical pressures exerted by inanimates.") Given as a 1st person aorist nirin. Pa.t. probably *nindë since the R of nir- was originally D (the base is given as NID; compare rer- pa.t. rendë from RED concerning the past tense; see SOW). –VT41:17
  PRESS (noun) sanga (crowd, throng) –STAG/Silm:438
  PRESSURE (to do something against one's will or conscience) sahtië (Þ) (force) –VT43:22
  PRETTY netya (dainty). (Note: netya- is also a verb "trim, adorn".) –VT47:33

  PRICK erca-, nasta- (sting); PRICKLE, SPINE erca –ERÉK, NAS

  PRIVACY aquapahtië (literally *"fully-closedness", used of a mind that closes itself against telepathic communication) –VT39:23
  PROCEED (in any direction) lelya- (pa.t. lendë) (go, travel). TO PROCEED (conjunction, = “furthermore”), see FURTHERMORE. –WJ:363
  PRODUCTION carmë (glossed "art" in UT:396, but cf. Oiencarmë Eruo "the One's perpetual production". Carmë is also translated "making".) –MR:329
  PROFOUND tumna (low-lying, low, deep, dark or hidden) –LT1:271 cf. TUB
  PROJECTIONS (seaward projections), see CAPE (OF LAND)
  PROLONG taita- –TAY
  PROMINENT minda (conspicuous), minya (eminent; basically ordinal "1st") –MINI, VT42:24, 25
  PROMISE (noun) (solemn promise:) vanda (oath, pledge) –UT:317

  PUFF hwesta-; PUFF OF AIR hwesta (breath, breeze), PUFF OF BREATH foa (breath) –SWES, VT47:35, 36
  PULL saca- (Þ) (draw). Since saca- may also mean "look for", for clarity it may be better to use #tuc- "draw", q.v. –VT43:23
  PUNISH paimeta- (= “exact or inflict a penalty; punish”), pa.t. perhaps *paimetánë; PUNISHMENT paimë –QL:72
  PURE poica –POY
  PURIFICATION sovallë (washing, bathing) –QL:86
  PURSUE roita-, also saca- (search, look for), p.a.t sácë –ROY1, QL:81
    PUT ASIDE hehta- (pa.t. hehtanë is given but seems perfectly regular) (leave out, exclude, abandon, forsake); PUT A STOP TO pusta- (stop, cease) –WJ:365, PUS

  PUT TO SHAME naitya- (abuse) –QL:65
  PUT TO THE TEST tyasta-, pa.t. tyasantë –QL:49

  <Q>
  QUANTITY (great) úvë (abundance) –UB
  QUARREL (vb) costa- –KOT
  QUEEN tári (gen. tário and dative tárin are also attested, the latter in the Elaine inscription). Vocative tarinya *"my Queen", UT:179. LT1:260 gives turinqui "queen", while LT1:273 gives vardi, but these are hardly valid words in LotR-style Quenya. QUEEN OF STARS (Varda's title) Elentári (so in LotR and Silm; Etym has also Tinwetári, Tinwetar, Tinwerontar); QUEEN OF THE EARTH Kementári (a title of Yavanna) –TĀ/LT1:264/Nam/RGEO:67, Silm:55/437/30

  <R>
  RACE nórë (land, country, dwelling-place, nation, native land, family) –NŌ
  RADAGAST Aiwendil ("Lover of Birds", his original Valinorean name, not an actual translation of "Radagast", which is either Adûnaic for "Tender of Beasts" or a Mannish name of uncertain meaning) –UT:393/417, cf. 390, 401
  RADIANCE alcar, alcarë (brilliance, splendour), incalë (compare Ancalë or "Radiant One" as a name of the Sun, LR:392 s.v. KAL, though it is not clear whether or not Tolkien abandoned this word), fairë (Note: the word fairë has several other meanings – see DEATH, FREEDOM, PHANTOM), nalta (glittering reflection [from jewels, glass, polished metals, or water] – alata in Silm:433 is the Telerin form, and alta in VT42:32 would seem to be a variant. In PM:347, nalta is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and we follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) RADIANT alcarinqua (glorious) –AKLA-R, VT45:36, PHAY, PM:347, WJ:369 (where alkar is translated "splendour")
  RAGE aha –LotR:1157
  RAIMENT #larma (attested in pl. form larmar). Note: a homophone means “[?pig]-fat”. –PE17:175
  RAIN mistë (fine rain), rossë (fine rain, dew, spray), ucco; RAINBOW helyanwë (lit. "sky-bridge"), Ilweran, Ilweranta. (LT2 has iluquinga "sky-bow", but this was obsoleted together with ilu "sky"; see SKY.) –MIZD, ROS cf. Letters:282, GL:74, 3EL, LT1:256, LT2:348
  RAISE orta- (lift up, rise) (pa.t. ortanë is attested; orta- probably obsoletes orto- in LT1:256), in early "Qenya" also amu- –ORO, Nam, RGEO:67, LT2:335
  RAPE (vb) mapta- (pa.t. mapantë) (ravish); noun RAPE maptalë (ravishment, seizure). –PE13:163
  RAPID larca, alarca –LAK
  RAT nyarro ("nyano" in LR:379 must be a misreading of Tolkien's manuscript; the primitive form is given as nyadrō, which could not possibly become "nyano" in Quenya). –NYAD, VT46:7
  RAVINE axa (narrow path), yáwë (cleft, gulf/gully), falqua (cleft, mountain pass) –AK, YAG/VT46:22, LT2:341
  RAVISH mapta- (pa.t. mapantë) (rape); noun RAVISHMENT maptalë (rape, seizure). –PE13:163
  RAY OF LIGHT alca; RAY OF THE SUN firin (the latter may not be a valid word in LotR-style Quenya; it would clash with the verb "I fade" or "I die"). –AKLA-R, LT2:341
 "RAYMENT, VEILS" fana (pl fanar is attested. This word was used of the visible bodies in which the Valar presented themselves to incarnates.) –RGEO:74 
  RE- (prefix) en- (as in entulessë "return" and envinyatar "renewer", q.v. Also used on verbs: #enquat- "refill" [only fut. enquantuva is attested, see REFILL]. Before the consonants l, m, r, s, the prefix en- would be assimilated to *el-, *em-, *er-, and *es-, respectively. Very early [The Lost Tales] "Qenya" has an- instead of en- [see LT1:184].)
  REACH (intr.) *rahta- (strech out) (Emended from the actual reading rakta; Tolkien later decided that kt became ht in Quenya) –LT1:335
  REACT ahtar- or accar- (do back, requite, avenge) –PE17:166
  READ tengwa- (verb denominated from tengwa “letter”), conjugated in many forms in source: aorist [teng]wa, present [teng]wëa, past [teng]wanë, perfect e[teng]wië; READING (verbal noun) tengwië (also attested with suffixes: tengwiesto “of your [dual] reading”). –VT49:47-48, 54
  READY (adj.) manwa (for "to ready" as a noun, cf. the verb manwa- "to prepare") –QL:59
  REAL anwa (actual, true) –ANA2
  REALM arda (region). This word means "any more or less bounded or defined place, a region" (WJ:402) or "a particular land or region" (WJ:413). Arda (with a capital A) was "the name given to our world or earth...within the immensity of Eä". –3AR, Letters:283 
  REAR (noun) tellë, (body-part:) pontë (ponti-) (back) –TELES, QL:75
  REASON, see CAUSE
  RECALL (i.e. remember) #enyal- (inf. or gerund enyalië) –UT:302, 317
  RECKON not-; *RECKONING #onótië (isolated from Yénonótië *"reckoning of years"), *RECKONER Onótimo (the untranslated title of one Quennar, an expert of chronology) –NOT, MR:48-51
  RECEIVE #cam- (attested in the past tense #camnë with pronominal endings added: camnelyes "you received it"). Early material also has tuvu- (same as in utúvienyes "I have found it"? See FIND) –VT47:21, GL:71
  RED carnë (stem carni-), aira ("ruddy, copper-coloured"), *narwa ("fiery red", cited in the archaic form narwā in the source. Cf. nárë "flame"), nasar (adopted from Valarin; used in Vanyarin Quenya only); RED [HEAT?] (Tolkien's handwriting was illegible) yulmë (Note: a homophone means "drinking, carousal".) RED FLAME rúnya, WITH ADORNMENT OF RED JEWELS carnimírië (a pl form? Sg *carnimírëa? Letters:224 has carne- instead of carni-.) –KARÁN/Silm:429, GAY, NAR, WJ:399, YUL, Silm:437, LotR:505 cf. Letters:224
  REDEEMER #runando (isolated from Mardorunando, "Redeemer of the World") –VT45:17
  REED liscë (sedge) –LT2:335 (GL:34 also gives feng-, but some ending would be required). It may be that at some stages of Tolkien’s conception, the word linquë was intended to mean *”grass, reed” (but elsewhere the same word is used as an adj. “wet” or as a noun “hyacinth”).
  REEK usquë –USUK
  REFILL #enquat- (only fut. enquantuva is attested, but cf. quat- "fill" in WJ:392). In another source the future tense appears as enquatuva. –Nam, VT21:6, 10; VT48:11
  REFLECTION (glittering) nalta (radiance – alata in Silm:433 is the Telerin form. In PM:347, nalta is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) –PM:347
  REFRESH ceuta- (renew) –VT48:7
  REFUSE váquet- (forbid, say no) (1st pers. sg aorist and past váquetin, váquenten are given) avaquet- (forbid) (pa.t. is no doubt *avaquentë; cf. quet- under SAY), ava- (say no). (Pa.t. avanë is given; this verb was "little used in ordinary language". Other forms occur in VT49:13, all with the ending -n “I”: Aorist avan, present ávan or ávëan, future avuvan > auvan, past avanen or aunen, perfect avávien. In one version, the forms ávëan and avanen are marked as poetic or archaic.)  –WJ:370, KWET, VT49:13
  REGARDS – see AS REGARDS  s
  REGION ména, arda (realm), harda –MEN, LotR:1157, VT45:12
  REGULAR sanya (Þ) (law-abiding, normal) (variant vorosanya with a prefixed element meaning "ever"). –STAN, VT46:16
  RECEIVE #cam- (attested in the pa.t. #camnë with pronominal affixes: camnelyes, "you received it") –VT47:21
  RELATE #nyar- (cited as nyarin, 1st pers. aorist) (tell); NOT TO BE TOLD OR RELATED avanyárima –NAR2, WJ:370
  RELEASE lerya- (set free, let go), fainu-, apsenë- (remit, forgive; see FORGIVE). RELEASED lehta (free); RELEASED ELEMENT (a term for "vowel") #lehta tengwë (only pl. lehta tengwi is attested; we would rather expect *lehtë tengwi). –VT41:5, 6, LT2:250, VT43:18, 20, VT39:17
  REMAIN lemya- (to tarry). Possibly this verb should have the past tense *lemnë rather than ?lemyanë, since intransitive verbs in –ya may seem to surrender this suffix in the past tense. REMAINS erin (evidently a verb; the ending -n for 3rd person rather than 1st person would not be valid in later Quenya. A verbal stem #er- "remain" may perhaps be isolated, but the source is very early and writers should rather use lemya-.) –VT45:26, LT1:269
  REMEMBER, see RECALL
  REMIT apsenë- (release, forgive; see FORGIVE). –VT43:18, 20
  REMOTE haira (far), eccaira, avahaira, vaháya or avaháya –KHAYA, VT45:21
  REND narca- (in the Etymologies as published in LR, "narka" in Tolkien's manuscript was misread as "narki"; see VT45:37), RENDING naraca (harsh, violent) (possibly "of sounds", but Tolkien's extra comment is partially illegible) –NÁRAK, VT45:37
  RENEW ceuta- (refresh), #envinyata- (heal) (isolated from Envinyatar, see below. Past participle Envinyanta is attested, though it is translated "healed" rather than *"renewed".) RENEWED ceura (so in VT48:8; the form ceurë on the previous page looks dubious, except as the plural form of this adj.). *RENEWAL ceulë (the likeliest meaning of this unglossed form), RENEWER Envinyatar –MR:405, VT48:7, 8, LotR:897
  REPAY paitya- (requite) –QL:72
  REPEAT tatya- (double); REPEATED vórima (changed by Tolkien from vorima) (continual), vórëa (enduring, continuous) –TATA, BOR, VT45:7
  REPETITION – continuous repetition: vorongandelë ("vorogandele" in the published Etymologies is a misreading; see VT45:7) (harping on one tune) –LIN1
  REPOSE Estë (the name of a Valië; because of this name, estë fell out of use as a general word for "repose"). According to VT46:12, Tolkien also considered erdë as a word for "repose", but he marked it with an X, possibly indicating that he considered abandoning this word because it clashed with erdë "seed, germ". Because of its uncertain status, writers should probably avoid erdë "repose". –WJ:403, 404
  REQUITE
  REACT ahtar- or accar- (do back, requite, avenge), paitya- (repay) –PE17:166, QL:72
  RESCUE (noun) rehtië (saving); this would seem to be the gerund of a verb *rehta- “rescue, save” (see SAVING for further discussion). –PE17:38
  RESONANCE OF THE VOCAL CHORDS óma (voice) –VT39:16
  RESONANT (of strings) tunga (taut, tight) –TUG
  RESPONSIBILITY cáma (guilt) –QL:43
  REST serin ("I rest", 1st pers. aorist); REST (noun) sérë (repose, peace), quildë (quiet, hush); Estë (the name of a Valië; because of this name, estë fell out of use as a general word for "rest") (repose); TAKE A REST hauta-; RESTING senda (at peace) –SED, EZDĒ/WJ:404, GL:23, KHAW
  RESTRAIN avalerya- (bind, make fast, deprive of liberty) –VT41:5, 6
  RETURN (vb) pel- (revolve, go round), RETURN (noun) entulessë –PEL, UT:171, 434
  REVEAL apanta- (pa.t. apantanë, apantë) (display); REVEALING (noun) pantië (opening, unfolding) –QL:34, 72
  REVERED: The element #ar- in Arfanyarassë (a name of Taniquetil) is said to mean "high (i.e., noble, revered)" –WJ:416
  REVERSED nuquerna (literally *”under-turned”) –LotR:1157
  REVOLVE pel- (return, go round) –PEL
  RICH alya (prosperous, abundant, blessed), lárëa (also = fat, and probably the best word for "rich" in the strictly material sense), autë (also as noun: prosperity, wealth), herenya (wealthy, fortunate, blessed). RICHES lar (fat) –GALA/VT42:32, VT45:26, LT2:335, KHER, VT45:26
  RIDER roquen (horseman, knight) –WJ:372, UT:282
  RIGHT téra (straight), vanima (fair, proper, beautiful). RIGHT (direction) forya (dexter), fortë (stem *forti-) (Note: the latter word also means "northern"); RIGHTHANDED formaitë (stem *formaiti-) (dexterous), RIGHT HAND forma –TE3, LT1:272, PHOR/VT46:10, VT47:6
  RIME ringwë (frost) –LT1:255
  RING #corma (isolated from cormacolindor "Ring-bearers"). The title "Lord of the Rings" Tolkien translated as Heru i Million, with #milli as the word for "rings" (singular *millë or less likely *mil with stem *mill-). The word *risil (quoted in archaic form rithil) appears in Rithil-Anamo or "Ring of Doom", the place where judgement was passed in Valinor; this would therefore be a "ring" on the ground.  RING-DAY Cormarë (Yavannië 30th, a festival in honour of Frodo Baggins; this was his birthday). RING-WRAITHS Úlairi (Nazgûl) (pl; sg #Úlairë? Note that Úlairi is not a literal translation of "ring-wraiths"; the prefix ú- may mean "un-" with evil connotation; the rest of the word is obscure. Lairë "summer" or "poem" can hardly have anything to do with #lairi. The syllable úl- may also have something to do with the Black Speech word gûl, wraith, or else the meaning may be "unliving (= undead) ones", with the root LAY that is normally associated with greenness but also with life: *ú-lai-ri "un-live-ly ones") –LotR:989 cf. Letters:308, LotR.1146, WJ:401, Silm:362, 417
  RINGING SOUND láma (echo – so in Etym, but see SOUND) –LAM
  RISE orta- (pa.t. ortanë is attested; orta- obsoletes oro- in LT1:256) (lift up, raise); RISING (noun) órë (Note: a homophone means "heart, inner mind"; but cf. MIGHTY-RISING); SUNRISE anarórë (LT1:264 has orontë, oronto, but these words may not be valid in LotR-style Quenya). –ORO, LT1:256, Nam/RGEO:67
  RIVER sírë (stream), also #sirya (attested in dual form siryat). (LT1:248/262 also gives nen, while LT1:260 gives celusindi; LT1:265 gives sindi; these may not be valid words in LotR-style Quenya.) The word hlóna (marked by a query by Tolkien) was to designate "a river, especially given to those at all seasons full of water from mountains". Regarding the conceptual validity of the word nuinë, –duinë (cognate of Sindarin duin as in Anduin), see nuinë in the Quenya-English wordlist.

  RUINOUS atalantëa (pl. atalantië is attested) –MC:222, 223
  RULE (vb)  heru- (Note: In Tolkien’s later Quenya, heru is primarily the noun "lord", so the later verb tur- “govern” may be preferred to this early “Qenya” verb.). LT1:273 has vard- "rule, govern", but this is hardly a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. RULE (noun, “a rule”) sanyë (Þ) (law), axan (commandment, law, as proceeding primarily from Eru; pl. axani is attested.) –LT1:272, STAN, WJ:399/VT39:30

  SAVE: the apparent gerund rehtië, “saving” or “rescue”, seems to imply a verb *rehta- “save, rescue” (see SAVING). Also see DELIVER. –PE17:38
  SAVING (noun) rehtië (rescue); this is seemingly the gerund of a verb *rehta- “rescue, save”; the underlying root REK is defined as “recover, get out/away, save from ruin/peril/loss”) –PE17:38
  SAY quet- (pa.t. quentë) (speak, talk), equë (the latter word "has no tense forms...being mostly used only before either a proper name...or a full independent pronoun, in the senses say / says or said. A quotation then follows, either direct, or less usually indirect after a 'that'-construction (...) Affixes appear in equen 'said I', eques 'said he / she' ." (WJ:392, 415) Attested forms include the aorist quetë and its pl. form quetir (VT41:11, 49:11). Cf. also SAY NO váquet- (forbid, refuse) (1st pers. sg aorist and past váquetin, váquenten are given), ava- (refuse) (pa.t. avanë is given; this verb was "little used in ordinary language". Other forms occur in VT49:13, all with the ending -n “I”: Aorist avan, present ávan or ávëan, future avuvan > auvan, past avanen or aunen, perfect avávien. In one version, the forms ávëan and avanen are marked as poetic or archaic.) NOT TO BE SAID, THAT MUST NOT BE SAID avaquétima.

  SERPENT lócë (snake, dragon; "so do the Eldar name the worms of Melko[r]", LT2:85). The word foalócë is said to be a "name of a serpent that guarded a treasure". The word is not capitalized, so this "name" must be a common noun and not a proper name. –LOK, LT2:340
  SERVANT núro (in the Etymologies as published in LR, the gloss is misread as "sunset"; see VT45:38), also –(n)dur (final element in compounds, e.g. arandur "king's servant, minister, steward". When the first part of the compound ends in l, n, or r, the n of –ndur is left out). –NDŪ, Letters:386

Note: there is a homophone meaning "firm, steadfast, strong, immoveable".) SET ASIDE #sat- (appropriate to a special purpose or owner).

  SEVENTEEN otoquë. For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. –VT48:21
  SEX, see COITUS
  SEXUAL DESIRE is the apparent meaning of yérë, a word that is not really glossed, but derived from the root YER "feel sexual desire" (VT46:23). The word hroafelmë, "body-impulse" (VT41:19 cf. 13) is also said to cover sexual desire (but likewise physical fear, hunger, or thirst).
  SHADE lëo (= shadow cast by an object), laimë, lómin (shadow); SHADES OF NIGHT lómë (Night, night-time, dusk, gloom, twilight), SHADY halda (veiled, hidden, shadowed), laira –DAY, LT1:255, DO3

"The Shadow" meaning Sauron should probably be Huinë, as this word is associated with his coming to Númenor in LR:47 and SD:246/310. SHADOWED halda (veiled, hidden, shady). –DAY/VT45:8, LT1:255, Nam/RGEO:67, PHUY, UÑG, MOR/VT45:35, LUM, SKAL

  SHAKE (vb.) pal-; pa.t. pallë given –PE16:143
  SHAKE (noun): In the Etymologies as printed in LR, rincë was glossed "quick shake", but according to VT46:11 the proper reading of Tolkien's manuscript is "quick stroke". –RIK, VT46:11
  SHAME (vb, "put to shame") naitya- (abuse). An abstract formation based on this verb, e.g. *naityalë, could serve as the noun “shame”. –QL:65

  SHARE hyanda (blade) –LT2:342
  SHARP maica (piercing), aica (fell, terrible, dire; this gloss "sharp" is isolated from one translation of Aicanáro:) SHARP-FLAME Aicanáro "Fell Fire, Aegnor" (so in Silm:435; MR:323 has Aicanár) In the printed Etymologies, a word for "keen, sharp, acute" is given as "laike" in the entry LAIK, but not only is this a misreading for "laika" (VT45:25): the conceptual validity of this word may be questioned because laika, laica is the word for "green" in later sources. –Silm:434, AYAK, MR:323, LAIK
  SHARP-PROWED SHIP cirya (see SHIP) –Silm:433 (where the spelling círya occurs, but all other sources have cirya with a short i, so círya is likely an error by Christopher Tolkien).

  SHEPHERD mavor (GL:58 gives mavar); SHEPHERDESS emerwen. The word mámandil, etymologically "sheep-friend" (máma "sheep" + –ndil "friend"), may perhaps also be used for "shepherd".  –LT1:268, UT:434, UT:209

  SHIP cirya (defined as "sharp-prowed ship" in Silm:433; dual ciriat [read *ciryat?] is attested in Letters:427; all numbers and cases except plural possessive *ciryaiva are attested in the Plotz letter. In Silm:433, the spelling círya occurs, but all other sources have cirya with a short i, so círya is likely an error by Christopher Tolkien); luntë (boat); SHIPMAN ciryaquen (sailor) –KIR, LT1:249/LUT, WJ:318
  SHIRT laupë (tunic) –QL:51
  SHOE hyapat –SKYAP (Note: In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the word hyapat is glossed "shore", but according to http://www.elvish.org/errata/VT-Errata.pdf, the proper reading of the gloss found in Tolkien's manuscript is "shoe".)
  SHORE falas (falass-), falassë (beach, line of surf, "especially one [i.e. a shore] exposed to great waves and breakers", VT42:15), fára (beach). In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the word hyapat is glossed "shore", but according to http://www.elvish.org/errata/VT-Errata.pdf, the proper reading of the gloss found in Tolkien's manuscript is "shoe". SHORE-PIPER, SHORELAND PIPER Solosimpë (pl Solosimpi is attested) –LT1:253, VT42:15, Silm:431, VT46:15, SKYAP, LT1:251, 265

Engwar "The Sickly", an Elvish name for Men), quámëa (evidently = *”nauseous”), SICKNESS quámë (= nausea), in the sense of illness probably rather lívë (maybe better spelt *hlívë), caila (or possibly this is only adj. lying in bed, bedridden; see caila in the Quenya-English wordlist for further discussion), caimassë (etymologically "[state of being] in bed") –SLIW, KAY/VT45:19, GENG-WĀ, Silm:122, KWAM
  SICKLE circa; SICKLE OF THE VALAR Valacirca (= the Great Bear, the Plough, the Big Dipper or the Wain), also called Otselen = The Seven Stars. –KIRIK, OT
 SIGH see EXPIRE. Cf. also one of Nienna's titles: Núri, she who sighs. –LT1:263 cf. 66.
 SIGN tanna, tanwa, #taina; tengwë (indication, token, writing; tengwë is also used for what we should call a phoneme – pl tengwi is attested), tehta (mark [in writing], diacritic) (In LotR:1155, this word is applied to the supralinear vowel-signs of Fëanorian writing, and pl tehtar is attested.) SYSTEM OR CODE OF SIGNS tengwesta (grammar). For various linguistic terms, see FULL SIGN, LACKING/INADEQUATE SIGN, STRIPPED/DEPRIVED SIGN. –PE17:186. MR:385, WJ:394, 395, TEK

  SILK samin (samind-); adj. SILKEN saminda, saminwa adj. “silken” (QL:81)
  SILVER telpë, telep- (tyelpë, tyelep- was the original form of the word in Noldorin Quenya, but "the form telpe became usual, through the influence of Telerin; for the Teleri prized silver above gold, and their skill as silversmiths was esteemed even by the Noldor" [UT:266]. However, in Letters:426 it is stated that "the form tyelpë remained in Quenya" and was not wholly displaced by telpë. LT1:268 has telpë = telempë.) Cf. also ilsa (a "mystic name" of silver), †silmë (also meaning light of Silpion, starlight). SILVER (prob. adj) tinda (glinting), OF SILVER telepsa, telpina, telemna. SILVER LIGHT istel, istil ("applied by the Ilkorins to starlight, probably a Q[uenya] form learned from Melian"). SILVER GLINT nillë (a star on Varda's simulacrum covering Valinor. Spelt ñillë, i.e., ngillë, in MR:388, but initial ng had become n in Third Age pronunciation, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But is this word is written in Tengwar, the letter noldo, not númen, should be used to transcribe the initial n.) –Silm:429, KYELEP, LT1:255, SIL, TIN, MR:388
 SIN (noun) #úcarë (isolated from úcaremmar "our sins/trespasses"; SIN (verb) #úcar- = "to sin, trespass" (pl. aorist úcarer, úcarir attested); SINNER #úcarindo (variant #ulcarindo, possibly an ephemeral form abandoned by Tolkien, which may also be true of the forms #naicando, #naico. All the words for "sinner" are attested with the pl. ending -r attached.) –VT43:19, 21, 22, 33
 SINCE (= because) pan. “Since” with reference to time (as in “they have been here since last year”) may perhaps be expressed as “from” or “after”, q.v. –VT49:17, 18
 SINEW tuo (muscle) –TUG
 SING #lir- as in lirin "I sing" (1st pers. aorist) (chant); SINGER nyello, lindo (singing bird); SINGERS Lindar (a name of the Teleri); SINGING lindë (air, tune, song), SINGING CLUSTER Lindeloktë (labernum). This is the form given in LT1:258; Tolkien later decided that kt became ht in Quenya. Read *Lindelohtë in LotR-style Quenya?  –GLIR, NYEL, LIN2, WJ:418, Silm:431, LT1:258
 SINGLE erya (sole), SINGLY eressë (only, alone, also as noun: solitude) –ERE, LT1:269

 SIP salpa- (lick up, sup) –SÁLAP
 SIRIUS Niellúnë, Nierninwa –LT1:262 
 SISTER nésa (þ; older form néþa cited), colloquially also nettë (probably netti-); the latter word was also used in children's play for "fourth finger" or "fourth toe" (or in two-handed play for the ninth digit). Different words for "sister" occur in the Etymologies: seler (Þ) (pl. selli), onómë, onónë; SISTER (usually not of bloodkinship) osellë (Þ) (associate) –VT47:10-12, 14, THEL, NŌ 
 SIT har- (in CO attested in the plural continuative tense: hárar "are sitting". According to VT45:20, Tolkien derived har- "sit" from a root KHAD; if so, the past tense of har- should probably be *handë rather than *harnë. In Etym, the root KHAD was rejected and replaced by KHAM-, and the new Quenya verb for "sit" thus came to be ham-. However, since har- reappears in such a late text as CO, Tolkien may have decided to reinstate KHAD and its derivatives; writers may then treat both har- and ham- as valid verbs for "to sit".) –KHAM, UT:317, VT45:20
 SIX enquë (for archaic, possibly pre-historic, encë, VT48:8). For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. SIXTH enquëa. Fraction ONE SIXTH enquesta –ÉNEK, VT42:25, VT48:6, 11
 SIXTEEN enenquë –VT48:21 (the form quainquë seems to be another, possibly experimental, word for "16" in Quenya). For the syntax of numerals, see THREE.
 SKIES fanyarë (upper airs and clouds) –MC:223
 SKILL curu; SKILLED maitë (stem *maiti-, pl. maisi) (handy), BE SKILLED IN DEALING WITH hanya- (understand, know about); SKILLFUL [?DEVICE – Tolkien's handwriting was illegible] curo (curu-)  –Silm:429, MA3, KHAN, VT41:10
 SKIN helma (fell) (parma in LT2:346 is obsolete; see BARK) –SKEL
 SKY vilya (older [MET] wilya) (air), hellë, ilwë (heavens), telimbo (canopy), taimë, taimië. (LT2:348 gives ilu, but the meaning of this word was later changed – Tolkien decided that Ilúvatar means "All-Father", not "Sky-Father" as he originally thought.) "SKY-BRIDGE" (i.e., rainbow) helyanwë –LotR:1157, 3EL, LT1:255, LT2:348, LT1:268
 SLACKEN lehta-, lenca- (loose) (In the printed Etymologies, the n of lenca- was misread as u; see VT45:27.) –LEK
 SLASH cirissë (gash) –KIRIS
 SLAVE mól (thrall) –MŌ, VT43:31
 SLAY nahta- (see also SLAYER concerning a possible alternative form #nehta-). Passive participle nahtana in the phrase *nahtana ló Turin *”slain by Túrin” (VT49:24). The verb mac- meant “slay” in early material (LT1:259), but in a much later source reproduced in VT39.11, this verb is translated "hew with a sword" instead.
 SLAYER #nehtar, isolated from Morinehtar "Darkness-slayer" (PM:384, 385), name of a wizard (istar). The noun #nehtar "slayer" may seem to presuppose a verbal stem #nehta- "to slay, kill", though the form nahta- appears elsewhere (VT49:24); this may be an example of Eldarin A/E variation.
 SLEEP (noun) fúmë. (Read perhaps *húmë, since Tolkien decided that fu- becomes hu- in Quenya. This word points to *fum- [hum-] as the stem of the verb "to sleep".)  FLOWER OF SLEEP – see POPPY. –LT1:253
 SLENDER nindë (stem *nindi-), teren, terenë –NIN-DI, TER

LT1:259, LOS, LT1:259, 260
 SMALL níca, *nincë (said to have "good senses"; the latter is given in the archaic form "ninki" and would therefore have the stem-form ninci-), nípa, *nimpë (said to be used "usually with connotation of weakness"; the latter adj. is given in the archaic form nimpi and would therefore have the stem-form nimpi-), pitya (the latter is never translated by Tolkien, but Pitya-naucor is glossed "petty-dwarves", and pica "small spot" must be derived from the same root.) In one compound, Tolkien seemingly changed pitya to nitya (see PM:365, VT48:15). Cf. also nauca, an adjective "especially applied to things that though in themselves full-grown were smaller or shorter than their kind, and were hard, twisted, or ill-shapen." LT1:256 has an adjective inya "small", but this is probably not a valid word in LotR-style Quenya (in which language *inya may mean "my, mine".) –VT48:18, VT47:26, PIK, WJ:389, 413
 SMALL INSECT pí (fly); SMALL MAN, see MAN; SMALL STONE sar (stem sard-, as in pl. sardi); YOUNG OR SMALL WOMAN, see GIRL. –VT47:35, SAR
 SMEAR mordo (shadow, obscurity, stain, dimness) –VT45:35, MOR
 SMEARED púrëa (discoloured) –MC:223
 SMELL (strong smell): The form aññol- is translated "strong smell" in one source (VT45:5), but this does not look like a regular Quenya word and is perhaps an underlying "stem" (Quenya *angol-?) The element ñol- is also translated "smell" in the same source, but again it is uncertain whether this is a primitive stem or a Quenya word (in the latter case, we would see *nol- in late Exilic Quenya). See ODOUR, STINK.
 SMILE raita-, pa.t. rëantë; SMILING raina (gracious, sweet-faced). NOTE: A homophone of raita- means “make network or lace” or “catch in a net” (its past tense may however be *raitanë rather than rëantë), and a homophone of raina means "nettled, enlaced". –PE17:182, VT44:35
 SMITH tano (craftsman), SMITH OF THE WORLD Talca Marwa (a title of Aulë) –TAN, LT1:266
 SMOOTH pasta –PATH

 SNOUT mundo (nose, cape). Stem *mundu-, given the primitive form mbundu. –MBUD
 SNOW lossë (spesifically "fallen snow", also adjective "snow-white"; †olos, †olossë. Etym also gives niquë, but this word is obsoleted by a statement in WJ:417: "nique does not refer to snow, but to cold". This statement may obsolete niquetil "snowcap" in LT1:266. Is niquis "snow" from the same source a valid word? GL:35 has fáwë "snow" and fauta "it snows".) LIGHT SNOW is, SNOW-WHITE lossë (which may also be the noun "snow"), SNOWDROP nieninquë (lit. "white tear") –RGEO:69, GOLÓS, NIK-W-, NEI, LT1:256, LT1:262/266
 SO may generally be rendered by sië "thus" (see THUS for reference). Also san (VT49:18) or sinen = “by this means, so” (VT49:18). The word ta is used to qualify adjectives, e.g. ta mára “so good” (VT49:12). MAY IT BE SO, see AMEN. IT IS SO ná (used = “yes”). 
 SOAP lipsa –LIB1

 SOLITARY eressëa (lonely; compare “Solitary Isle” as one translation of Tol Eressëa, Letters:386), erda (deserted) –LT1:269

 SOMEBODY (impersonal personal pronoun) mo (one). –VT49:20
 SOMBRE morna (black, gloomy, dark) –MOR
 SON yondo (male descendant), also short form yón (Yón referring to Jesus as "the Son" in the source); dative i yondon "to the Son" in VT43:36-37. Cf. also the suffix –ion, e.g. Finwion "son of Finwë". Variant yonyo "son, big boy" (a term also used for "middle finger" or "middle toe" in children's play, though Tolkien may have replaced it by hanno "brother", VT48:4). Vocative yonya *"my son", a contraction of *yondonya. (The forms vô, vondo "son" in LT2 are probably obsolete, as are the notions there recorded that yondo meant "(great) grandson" and that yô-, yond- "son" was used only in poetry. But LT2 does confirm that –ion was "very common...in patronymics".) SON OF THE DARK (= Morgoth) morion –YO, VT44:12, 17, VT43:36-37, MR:217, VT47:10, 15, LR:61, LT2:336, 344, LT1:260 cf. FS
 SONG lindë (air, tune, singing), #lírë (only attested in the instrumental case: lírinen, so the stem-form would seem to be líri-), lirilla (lay). See also MUSIC. –GLIN, Nam, LT1:258
 SOON rato –Arct            
 SORCERY núlë (black arts). (The word is spelt “ñúle” in the source, reflecting the older pronunciation; in Tengwar spelling the initial nasal should therefore be represented by the letter Noldo). –PE17:125
 SORROW nyérë (grief). –GL:60 
 SORT, see SPECIES, KIND. Adjectives OF THIS SORT sítë, OF THAT SORT taitë –VT49:11, 18

 SOUND (verb, "to sound") lamya-; SOUND (noun) lamma (= sound in general?), hlón (evidently hlon-, pl. hloni is attested) (noise), róma (= loud sound, trumpet-sound. Note: róma also means "shoulder"), láma (according to Etym = "ringing sound, echo", but see below); SOUND OF WIND sú; SOUND-TASTE lámatyávë (pl. lámatyáver is attested), i.e., "individual pleasure in the sounds and forms of words". Tolkien seems undecided about the exact meaning of láma. Etym gives "ringing sound, echo"; in WJ:416 it is said that the stem LAMA refers "especially to vocal sounds, but was applied only to those that were confused or inarticulate. It was generally used to describe the various cries of beasts." But the word lámatyávë "sound-taste", by which an Elf chose or made a name for him/herself [see NAME-CHOOSING], seems to imply that láma can also be used of artuculated speech. –LAM, WJ:394/VT48:29, ROM, VT47:12, MR:215, 216
 SOUP sulpa –LT1:266
 SOUTH hyarmen (LT2:248 also gives Sahóra, but this is hardly a valid word in Tolkien's later Quenya); SOUTHERN hyarmenya, "SOUTH-VICTOR" Hyarmendacil (one of the Kings of Gondor), SOUTHEASTLANDS Hyarrostar, SOUTHWESTLANDS Hyarnustar (regions in Númenor) –KHYAR/LotR:1157, LotR:1075/1082, UT:165, 446

 SPARKLE (vb) tintina- (pl. tintinar is attested), MAKE TO SPARKLE tinta- (kindle); SPARK (noun) tinwë (often = "star"). In the entry TIN of the Etymologies as printed in LR, the noun tinwë is glossed "sparkle", but according to VT46:19, Tolkien's manuscript has "spark". –TIN, Silm:438
 SPEAK quet- (pa.t. quentë) (say, talk). Aorist quetë (spelt “qete”) in source. Also carpa, pa.t. carampë (talk, use tongue; the latter verb apparently does not take a direct object).  –LT2:348, VT49:19
 SPEAR hatal, ehtë, stem *ehti-. (The gloss of the word ecco has also been quoted as "spear", but this is a misreading; see SPINE.) SPEAR-HEAD nehtë (gore, wedge, narrow promontory.

 SPINE ecco (In the Etymologies as printed in LR, entry EK/EKTE, this word and its "Noldorin"/Sindarin cognate ech are glossed "spear", but according to VT45:12, this is a misreading for "spine" in Tolkien's manuscript.)
 SPINNING WHEEL querma (turn-table) –PE17:65
 SPIRANT CONSONANT surya –SUS
 SPIRIT fëa (= the spirit or "soul" of an incarnate, normally housed in a body; pl fëar is attested), ëala ("being"; pl. eälar is attested. Eälar are spirits whose natural state it is to exist without a physical body, e.g. Balrogs), súlë (Þ) (earlier [MET] thúlë, Þúlë) (maybe a more "impersonal" word for spirit), manu (= departed spirit; LT1:260 has mánë), fairë (= spirit in general, as opposed to matter, or a phantom or disembodied spirit, when seen as a pale shape. Pl. fairi is attested), vilissë (a "Qenya" word maybe not valid in LotR-style Quenya). A person's "spirit" meaning his or her general personality and attitude may be expressed by the word órë, in LotR defined as "heart, inner mind" (q.v.), cf. PM:337, where it is said that "there dwelt in her [Galadriel] the noble and generous spirit (órë) of the Vanyar". FIELD-SPIRIT Nermi (pl. Nermir is attested. The Nermir are "fays of the meads".)  HOLY SPIRIT airefëa (other version: fairë aista; both versions are attested with the dative ending -n attached).

Also used = dayspring, early morn. In the Calendar of Imladris, tuilë was a precisely defined period of 54 days, but the word was also used without any exact definition. Besides tuilë, LT1:269 also has tuiliérë.) FIRST BEGINNING OF SPRING coirë ("stirring", according to the Calendar of Imladris a period of 54 days in early spring); "SPRING-SINGER" (i.e., swallow) tuilindo.

  STAR elen (normal pl eleni, but occasionally †eldi in verse; allative elenna and pl ablative elenillor are attested), †él (pl. éli is mentioned), tinwë (properly = sparkle), ílë. (Note: in Etym elen is said to be poetic, but Tolkien later concluded that elen was "the normal word for a star on the actual firmanent", the poetic word being él instead. According to MR:388, a tinwë was one of the "apparent stars" on Varda's simulacrum covering Valinor, also called nillë or "silver glint". Etym mentions the words ellen and elena without glossing them, but according to Silm:431 elena is an adjective meaning "of the stars".)

  STRAP latta (Note: a homophone means "hole, pit") –LATH
  STRAY ranya- (note: ranya or aranya is also the adjective "free"), STRAYING (noun) ránë (wandering) (pl. probably *ráner not ráni; cf. the similar formation tyávë "taste" pl tyáver.) –RAN

  STRIPPED #racina (only pl. racinë is attested) (deprived). STRIPPED SIGN #racina tengwë (only pl. racinë tengwi is attested).

  STRONG tulca (firm, immoveable, steadfast. Note: there is a homophone meaning "fix, set up, establish"), STRONG (physically) polda (burley). STRONG/SWIFT AT RUNNING nórima. In the Etymologies as printed in LR, the word sarnë is glossed "strong place" (entry SAR), but according to VT46:12, the gloss should actually read "stony place". –TULUK, POL, VT49:29
  STUDY (long) nólë (wisdom, lore, knowledge). (In Etym this word is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. Nólë is so spelt also in Silm:432. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) –ÑGOL, Silm:432

In the Calendar of Imladris, lairë was a precisely defined period of 72 days, but the word was also used without any exact definition), saiwen (cf. saiwa "hot".)

However, several words that must be derived from the same stem occur in LotR, indicating that Tolkien restored it.) Naira ("the heart of flame"), Calavénë, Calaventë (other names for the Sun). Yet another term was Ancalë or "Radiant One", but it is unclear whether or not Tolkien rejected this form (see LR:362 s.v. KAL). NEW SUN AFTER SOLSTICE ceuranar (VT48:7). SUNLIGHT árë (older [MET] ázë); SUNRISE anarórë, ambaron/Ambarónë (uprising, Orient) (a similar but untranslated word, Ambaróna, occurs in LotR), rómen (glossed "uprising, sunrise, east" in Silm:437, but the normal meaning of the word is always "east"). SUNSET andúnë (west, evening). (Amuntë in LT2 is certainly obsolete in LotR-style Quenya.) RAY OF THE SUN firin (this may not be a valid word in LotR-style Quenya; in a later source, firin is the adjective "dead"). –ANÁR, UR, LotR:1157, LotR:254, ORO, AM, LotR:490, NDU, MR:198, Silm:428, LT2:335, 341

The fraction ONE TENTH is given as caista (and cast) in VT48:11, but since Tolkien later decided that the word for "ten" was to have the initial sound qu- rather than c-, we must apparently read *quaista (and *quast, but normally Quenya words do not end in consonant clusters). –VT48:6, 11, VT47:7, VT42:25, cf.

  THANKSGIVING #hantalë (isolated from Eruhantalë "thanksgiving to Eru". A verbal stem #hanta- "thank" can also be isolated.) –UT:436 
  THAT (1) (demonstrative): tana (an adjectival word, VT49:11; in one version of the language also tanya, as in tanya wendë "that maiden", MC:215-16). Also yana with meaning “the former” (e.g. *loa yana “that year” referring to a former year). Adj. OF THAT SORT taitë; IN THAT WAY tanen; THAT MATTER tama. Also see THIS regarding the word talumë “at this [or, that] time”. –TA, YA, VT49:11, 18
  THAT (2) (pronoun) ta, also translated “it”. (Notice that in some versions of the language, Tolkien wanted ta to be a plural pronoun “they, them” used of non-living things. See the various entries on ta in the Quenya-English wordlist.) Sa, normally translated “it”, is also defined as “that” in one source. IT IS THAT náto, IT IS NOT THAT uito. –VT49:11, TA, VT49:18, 28
  THAT (3) (relative pronoun "who[m], which, that"). According to VT47:21, the relative pronoun is ye with reference to a person (*i Elda ye tirnen "the Elf who/that I watched"), plural i (e.g. *Eldar i... "Elves that..."). The impersonal relative pronoun ("that = which") is ya (e.g. *i parma ya hirnen "the book that/which I found"), pl. presumably *yar (*i parmar yar... "the books that..."). This gives a system with great symmetry, but Tolkien also used i in a singular sense, in the sentence i Eru i or ilyë mahalmar ëa "the One who is [or, that is] above all thrones", though i is indeed plural in i carir quettar ómainen "those who [or, those that] form words with voices". A relative pronoun ya *"which" is found in the "Arctic" sentence; a long variant yá also occurs in the corpus (VT43:27-28). Case-forms: The plural locative of ya is attested as yassen "in which" in Nam (sg. *yassë), the genitive and ablative forms of ye are attested as yëo and yello respectively in VT47:21, and the same source gives ion and illon as the corresponding plural forms. –VT47:21, WJ:391, UT:305, 317, Arct
  THAT (4) (conjunction, as in "I know that you are here") i, cf. the sentence savin Elessar ar i nánë aran Ondórëo “I believe Elessar really existed and that he was a king of Gondor”  (VT49:27). In one version of early “Qenya”, this conjunction appeared as ne instead (PE14:54).
  THATCH tupsë –TUP
  THE i. – In Quenya, the definite article is generally used as in English. However, notice that it is not used before plural words denoting an entire people or race, such as Valar, Quendi, Noldor, Sindar, Eldar, Ainur, Fírimar etc. This is evident from examples like lambë Eldaron "the language of the Eldar [lit. simply "Eldar"]", Valar valuvar "the will of the Valar [lit. simply "Valar"] will be done". Cf. Tolkien's use of "Men" with no article, meaning the entire human race or humans in general, while "the Men" would be a group of individuals. Anar "the Sun" and Isil "the Moon" are probably treated like proper names in Quenya; they do not take the article. When a noun is determined by a following genitive, it is evidently optional whether it takes the article or not: mannar Valion "into the hands [lit. simply "hands"] of the Lords", Indis i Ciryamo "The Mariner's Wife, *The Wife [lit. simply "Wife"] of the Mariner" – but contrast I Equessi Rúmilo "the Sayings of Rúmil", i arani Eldaron "the Kings of the Eldar". If the genitive precedes the noun it connects with, the article must probably be left out in all cases, as in English (*Eldaron arani, ?Eldaron i arani). Note: i is also the relative pronoun "who, that" and the conjunction “that”; see THAT #3 and #4. –I, WJ:404, 368, FS, UT:8,  WJ:398, 369     
  THEE (object form of THOU, or singular YOU) lye, tye; see THOU for full discussion and references. Ólë in VT43:29 probably meant *"with thee" at the time of writing, but Tolkien apparently decided to go for –lye rather than just –le as the relevant ending; compare aselyë “with thee” in a later source. –VT43:29, VT47:31
  THEFT pilwë (robbery) –QL:73
  THEIR may be expressed as the ending -lta (also -ltya) added to nouns (VT49:16), e.g. *aldalta or *aldaltya = “their tree”. – In some sources, Tolkien instead gives the ending as -nta (nassentar pl. “their true-being[s]”, PE17:174) or -ntya (called an “archaic” form in VT49:17), just as he hesitated between -ltë and -ntë as the ending for “they” (VT49:17; see THEY). In “colloquial Quenya”, the ending -rya could also be used for the plural pronoun “their” (símaryassen  “in their imaginations”, VT49:16), because it was felt to contain the plural ending -r, but in “correct” written Quenya -rya was rather the ending for “his, her, its” (VT49:17). – According to VT49:17, the vowel -i- is inserted before the ending -lta/-ltya or -nta/-ntya when it is added to a stem ending in a consonant (but the evidence concerning connecting vowels before pronominal endings is rather diverse). – All these words for “their” are plural; the ending for dual “their” (describing something owned by two persons) is given in VT49:16 as -sta, but this clashes with a similar ending belonging to the second rather than the third person. The corresponding ending for “they” was (according to VT49:51) changed from -stë to -ttë, seemingly implying *-tta as the ending for dual “their”: hence e.g. *aldatta, “the tree of the two of them”. – No independent words for “their, theirs” are attested. Analogy may point to *tenya (plural) and *túnya or *tunya (dual), based on (attested) ten and (unattested) *tún as the dative forms of the pronouns te, tú “they” (plural and dual, repectively). Compare such attested forms as ninya “my” and menya “our”  vs. the dative pronouns nin “for me”, men “for us”.
  THEM, see THEY
  THEMSELVES (reflexive pronoun) intë (for older imte, asterisked by Tolkien). A reflexive ending -ttë “they…themselves” existed at one conceptual stage (melittë, “they love themselves”), but it is uncertain how lasting this idea was; elsewhere, -ttë is explained as being ending for dual “they” instead.  –VT47:37, VT49:21
  THEN tá (VT49:11); the “Qenya” form san occurring in early material (MC:216) rather looks like the dative form of sa “it” in Tolkien’s later versions of the language. Another word glossed “then”, tai, is used for “they, them” elsewhere (VT49:33).
  THENCE tó, talo; cf. also epeta, epta = “following that, thereupon, thence, whereupon” –VT49:11-12
  THERE tás, tassë. Also compare tanomë “in the place (referred to)”, *”there”. THERE, LOOK! (as interjection) en (yonder). The form ta is defined as “there” in VT49:33, but this may be a basic root rather than a Quenya word. –VT49:11, EN, VT45:12, 19
  THEREFORE etta, tánen, potai (som of these forms may have been ephemeral in Tolkien’s conception; etta is perhaps the best alternative). –VT49:11, 12
 THEREUPON epeta, epta (following that, thence, whereupon) –VT49:12
  THEY, THEM (3rd person pl. and dual forms): As the pronominal ending for “they”, Tolkien hesitated between -ltë and -ntë. For instance, a verb like “they do” is attested both as cariltë and carintë (VT49:16, 17). In one text, the ending -ltë is marked as archaic or poetic (VT49:17), but in other paradigms no such qualification occurs (VT49:51). The alternative form -nte- occurs in UT:317, with a second pronominal marker (-s “it”, denoting the object) following: Tiruvantes "they will keep it". General considerations of euphony may favour -ltë rather than -ntë (e.g. *quenteltë rather than *quententë for “they spoke” – in the past tense, many verbs end in -ntë even before any pronominal endings are supplied, like quentë “spoke” in this example). The ending -ltë (unlike -ntë) would also conform with the general system that the plural pronominal endings include the plural marker l (VT48:11). – In Tolkien’s early material, the ending -ltë appears as -lto instead (e.g. tulielto “they have come”, LT1:270). – A simple plural verb (with ending -r) can have “they” as its implied subject, as in the example quetir en “they still say” (PE17:167). –  In the independent pronouns, distinct forms of may be used depending on whether “they, them” refers to living beings (persons, animals or even plants) or to non-living things or abstracts. The “personal” independent pronoun is te, which may have a long vowel when stressed (té, VT49:51). It is also attested in object position (laita te “bless them”, LotR:989 cf. Letters:308, VT43:20). It can receive case endings, e.g. dative ten (VT49:14; variant forms téna and tien, VT49:14, VT43:12, 21). As the “impersonal” they, them referring to non-living things, Tolkien in some sources used ta (VT43:20; 8, 9), but this apparently caused dissatisfaction because he also wanted ta to be the singular pronoun “that, it”. According to VT49:32, the form tai was introduced as the word for impersonal or inanimate “they, them” (in some places changed to te, apparently suggesting that Tolkien considered using te for both personal and impersonal “they/them”, abandoning the distinction). Another source (VT49:51) lists sa as the pl. impersonal form, but all other published sources use this pronoun for singular impersonal “it”, not pl. “they”. – The object “them” can also be expressed by the ending -t following another pronominal suffix (laituvalmet, “we shall bless [or praise] them", LotR:989 cf Letters:308). Presumably this ending -t makes no distinction between personal and impersonal forms. – Quenya also possesses special dual forms of “they, them”, used where only two persons or things are referred to (none of these pronouns distinguish between personal and impersonal forms). In VT49:16, the old ending for dual “they” is given as -stë (marked as archaic or poetic), but this would clash with the corresponding 2nd person ending. According to VT49:51, this ending was changed (also within the imaginary world) from -stë to -ttë, which seems the better alternative (*carittë, “the two of them do”). The independent dual pronoun is given as tú (ibid.) However, it may also be permissible to use te for “they, them” even where only two persons are involved (te is seemingly used with reference to Frodo and Sam in one of the examples above, laita te “bless them”). – Genitive forms, see THEIR; reflexive pronoun, see THEMSELVES.

  THINGOL Singollo, short for Sindacollo (so in Silm:421; MR:217 and WJ:410 have Sindicollo, where the s represents original th, cf. PM:337, where the spelling Þindikollo is used [Þ = th as in thin]. Hence, these variant forms should be spelt with in initial súlë, not silmë, in Tengwar writing). However, it appears that Thingol was usually called Elwë in Quenya. –MR:385

  THIRTEEN yunquentë (also yunquenta); a Common Eldarin form nelekwe listed elsewhere could yield  *nelequë or *nelquë in Quenya. The form quainel seems to be another, possibly experimental, word for "13" in Quenya, and so is nelquëa. For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. –VT47:15, 40, VT48:21

THIS DAY (or, "today") síra (other variants, possibly rejected by Tolkien: siar, siarë, hyárë [archaic hyázë]); THIS HOUR sillumë; IN THIS PLACE sinomë [variant sínomë]; adj. OF THIS SORT site; AT THIS TIME silumë (referring to the present of the time of speech), talumë (referring to “the time we are thinking of or speaking of”). –UT:305, VT43:18, VT44:35, LotR:1003/VT44:36, VT49:11, 12 18

  THORN necel, in earlier material also nassë (spike), though the latter word also means “person” or “true-being” or even “(s)he is”, leaving necel a less ambiguous alternative. –PE17:55, NAS
  THORONDOR Sorontar –Silm:438
  THOU (singular 2nd person pronoun, distinct from plural “you” – the Quenya forms here discussed are not archaic like English “thou”, but simply express singular “you”). Quenya makes a distinction between a formal or polite “thou” and an intimate or familiar “thou”, the latter being reserved for use between close friends, family members, and lovers (VT49:51, 52). The formal pronoun normally appears as the ending -lyë or (if shortened) -l that is added to verbs, e.g. hiruvalyë “thou shalt find [it]” (Nam), caril or carilyë *“thou dost” or *“you (sg.) do” (VT49:16). The short form in -l may be the more usual, though the long form -lye- must be used if a second pronominal ending denoting the object of the verb is to be added (e.g. *cenuvalyes “thou shalt see it”, with the ending -s “it” appended). The ending -lyë may also be added to prepositions (aselyë “with thee”, VT43:29). The independent pronoun is lye, with a long vowel (lyé, VT49:51) when stressed. This pronoun can also appear in object position (English “thee”), e.g. nai Eru lye mánata, by Tolkien translated “God bless you” (VT49:39). Case endings may be added, e.g. allative lyenna *“upon thee” (VT49:40, 41). There is also elyë “thou, even thou” (Nam, RGEO:67) as an emphatic pronoun (Nam); apparently this can also receive case endings. Such independent pronouns may also be used in copula-less constructions, e.g. aistana elyë "blessed [art] thou" (VT43:30). – The intimate or familiar pronoun is similar in form, only with t instead of l. The pronominal ending is thus -tyë, as in carityë “thou dost, you (sg.) do” (VT49:16). It is uncertain whether -tyë has a short form -t (the existence of a short form is explicitly denied in VT49:51, but -t is listed in VT49:48). At one conceptual stage Tolkien mentioned such an ending that could be added to imperatives (hecat “get thee gone”, WJ:364), but he may have dropped it because it clashed with -t as a dual ending on verbs. The independent pronoun is tye, with a long vowel when stressed (tyé, VT49:51); presumably there also exists an emphatic pronoun *etyë (still unattested). Like lye, the pronoun tye may also appear in object position (ar inyë, yonya, tye-méla “and I too, my son, love thee”, LR:61); we must also assume that tye (and emphatic *etyë) can receive case endings. – Genitive forms, see THY.
  THOUGH, see ALTHOUGH
  THOUGHT sanwë; COMMUNICATION OF THOUGHT, INTERCHANGE OF THOUGHT (= telepathy) ósanwë; THOUGHT-OPENING sanwë-latya (direct, telepathic thought-transfer); THOUGHT-SENDING sanwe-menta (mental message) –VT39:23, 30, MR:415, VT41:5
  THOUSAND: No term is yet known for LotR-style Quenya; in one version of earlier "Qenya" this numeral was húmë (PE13:50). Pl. húmi is attested (used after other numbers, as in "two thousand", i.e. "two thousands"). In later Sindarin the word was apparently meneg (as in Menegroth, the Thousand Caves). The Quenya cognate has been theorized to be *mencë, but húmë may be used until a later term becomes available.
  THRALL mól (slave) –MŌ
  THREAD (fine) lia (spider filament. Note: lia- is also the verb "twine".) –SLIG
  THREE neldë (the “Qenya” form olë in LT1:258 apparently did not survive into Tolkien’s later Quenya). Tolkien used neldë to illustrate the syntax of numerals “from…3 onwards”: The numeral follows the noun, which also receives any case endings, and the numeral is indeclinable: eleni neldë “three stars”, genitive elenion neldë “of three stars”. – In older usage, the noun would appear in the genitive plural, so that “three stars” would be elenion neldë (literally, three of stars) and case endings would be added to the numeral, so that genitive “of three stars” would be elenion neldëo; notice that the numeral inflects as a singular noun. –NEL, SA:neldor, VT47:11, VT48:6, VT49:45

  THROAT lanco (This was changed by Tolkien from lango, pl. langwi [the latter form is erroneously marked with an asterisk in the printed Etymologies, but langwi is transparently the plural and not an ancestral form, and Tolkien's own manuscript had no asterisk: see VT45:26]. The plural form indicates that lango had the stem-form langu-. If the replacement form lanco is to behave similarly, it should have the stem *lancu- and the plural form *lanqui.) –LAK1, LANK
  THRONE mahalma (loc. pl. mahalmassen is attested) –UT:317

  THROUGH terë, ter; also used of time (with the sense of “through[out]”) in VT49:41: ter coivierya *“throughout his/her life”. "THROUGH-ABIDE" (i.e., stand [fast]) #termar- (only fut. termaruva is attested) –TER, UT:305, 317, VT44:35
  THROW: the verb hat- “fling” may be used.
   THRUST nir- (press, force [in a given direction]). ("Though applicable to the pressure of a person on others, by mind and 'will' as well as by physical strength, [this verb] could also be used of physical pressures exerted by inanimates.") Given as a 1st person aorist nirin. Pa.t. probably *nindë since the R of nir- was originally D (the base is given as NID; compare rer- pa.t. rendë from RED concerning the past tense; see SOW). –VT41:17
  THUMB nápo; in children's play also called atto or atya ("daddy"), a term also used of the big toe. Other terms for "thumb" (toltil, tollë and tolpë) were apparently abandoned by Tolkien. –VT47:10, 13, 26, VT48:4  
  THUS sië; cf. also sinen “by this means, so”. The word sin, occurring in the untranslated sentence sin quentë Quendingoldo, has also been interpreted as “thus” (*“thus spoke Quendingoldo/Pengolodh”). –VT49:18, PM:401
  THWART hranga- (said to be a weak verb) (PE17:154). Note: hranga is also an adjective “awkward, hard; stiff, difficult”. 
  THY (= singular YOUR) -lya, -tya (endings used on nouns, VT49:16, 48), e.g. *aldalya, *aldatya "thy tree". The semantic distinction between -lya and *-tya is that -lya is formal or polite, whereas -tya is intimate or familiar (see THOU). In UT:51 (cf. 22), -lya is translated "your" instead of "thy", following modern English usage (tielyanna "upon your path", with the allative ending -nna “upon” following -lya “your”). Independent words for “thy/thine” or “your/yours” (sg.) could possibly be *lyenya and *tyenya, derived from *lyen and *tyen as the theoretical dative forms of the independent pronouns lye, tye “thou” (compare ninya “my” and menya “our” as attested pronouns seemingly derived from the dative pronouns nin “for me”, men “for us”). 
  THYSELF (reflexive pronoun), see YOURSELF
  TIDE – lowtide: nanwë (ebb); high tide: luimë (flood). Partially illegible glosses referred to in VT48:30 may suggest that luimë can also refer to any tide, or the spring tide. –VT48:26, 23, 24, 30

  TIGHT tunga (taut, [of strings:] resonant) –TUG
  TILL an (for, to) –Arct
  TILTED talta- (sloping, leaning) –TALÁT
  TIME lúmë (translated "hour" in LotR:94; allative lúmenna is attested. Note: lúmë also means "darkness"). Pl. locative lúmissen “at the times” (VT49:47). Cf. also lú (= "a time, occasion"). FIXED TIME asar (Vanyarin athar) (festival); pl. asari is attested. ONCE UPON A TIME  yassë, yalúmessë, yáressë (Note: the first of these seems to clash with *yassë "in/on which".) MEAL TIME mat (matt-) AT ONE TIME (in the past), see ONCE. AT THIS TIME silumë (referring to the present of the time of speech). The word talumë is translated “at this time” in the sense of “at the time we are thinking or speaking of”, hence de facto meaning *”at that time” (the element ta- is normally defined “that”, not “this”). –LU, WJ:399/VT39:31, YA, QL:59, VT49:11-12

  TISSUE lannë (cloth) –LAN
  TITLE see NICKNAME.
  TO, TOWARDS ana, na, an (for, till); (prefix:) ana-. English "to, towards, –wards" will often be rendered by the allative ending -nna, pl -nnar, as in Elenna "Starwards" (Elen + [n]na). The dative case in -n may also express “to” or “for” in English, and shares the same origin as the preposition na. –NĀ, Plotz letter, UT:432, Silm:313, VT49:14
  TODAY (or, "this day") síra (other variants, possibly rejected by Tolkien: siar, siarë, hyárë [archaic hyázë]) –VT43:18
  TOE taltil (taltill-) (said to be the word for toe in "ordinary language", VT47:10). The term nútil (nútill-, pl. nútilli given), "under-point", is also used to mean "toe". BIG TOE taltol, also tolbo (read perhaps *tolvo in the more usual form of Quenya). The word atto, atya, basically "daddy", is said to be used for "big toe" (and "thumb") in children's play, like the word nettë (prob. netti-) "sister" is said to be used for "fourth toe" (or "fourth finger", or even referring to the ninth digit when both hands/feet are considered). The word selyë "daughter" was also introduced as a name for the fourth finger/toe (counting from the big toe/thumb) in children's play (VT47:10), but Tolkien apparendly abandoned it (VT47:15). The terms yonyo "big boy, son" and tolyo (also tollo) "stricker-up" could be used of the middle finger or toe. The word winimo "baby" (exilic *vinimo) was used for "little finger" or "little toe".-VT47:10-12, 15, 26, VT48:6

  TOMB #noirë (isolated from Noirinan, "Valley of the Tombs"; unless this compound is meant to contain a plural form noiri, it would suggest that #noirë has the stem-form noiri-). –UT:166
  TOMORROW enwa. In one conceptual phase, noa meant “tomorrow”, but this is elsewhere used = “yesterday”.  –QL:34, VT49:20
 -TON (reduced form of "town" in names) –mas (-by) –LT1:251  
  TONGUE (physical tongue:) lamba, (language:) lambë, quetil (the latter also = "talk" or "language"). (In LT2:339, it is said that lambë covers both "physical tongue" and "speech", but Tolkien later thought better of that. WJ:394  states that in non-technical use, lambë was the normal word for "language"; only the Loremasters used the technical term tengwesta instead.) LOREMASTER OF TONGUES #Lambengolmo (only pl Lambengolmor is attested, in VT48:6 also translated "linguistic loremasters"). USE TONGUE, see TALK. –LAB/LotR:1157/WJ:394, 396, KWET/VT45:25, VT48:6

  TOPMOST PINNACLE see FINISH.
  TORMENT (vb) nwalya-. (Though spelt this way also in Etym, nwalya- must be from older *ngwalya, for the stem is ÑGWAL. In Tengwar spelling, the letter nwalmë (< older ngwalmë) should be used to transcribe the initial nw of nwalya.) TORMENT (noun) nwalmë (older [MET] ngwalmë), angaitya –LotR:1157 cf. ÑGWAL; LT1:249 
  TORTURE ungwalë; ("Qenya" also:) malcanë, valcanë –ÑGWAL, LT1:250

  TOUGH norna (stiff), tarya (stiff) –WJ:413, TÁRAG
  TOWARDS ana, na, an (for); (prefix:) ana- (to). Very often, Quenya would use the allative case in -nna to express “towards”. –NĀ
  TOWER mindon (also translated "Lofty Tower"; allative pl mindonnar or mindoninnar is attested) (turret), mindo (=isolated tower), tirion (= watchtower; also defined as "a mighty tower, a city on a hill), tirin (= tall tower; Note: a homophone means "I watch") See also TOWN WITH WALLS AND TOWERS. –LT2:346/MC:222, MINI, LT1:258, TIR

HAVING TREES, TREE-GROWN aldarwa, TREE-TOP aldinga, TREE-SHADOWED aldëa, AVENUE OF TREES aldëon; LORD OF TREES Aldaron (a name of Oromë)  –GALAD/Nam/LotR:1147/1157/VT39:7, VT47:28, OR-NI/LotR:488 cf. Letters:308, LT1:267, LT1:249, Silm:32, 378 
  TRESPASS (noun) #úcarë (isolated from úcaremmar "our sins/trespasses"; verb úcar- "to sin, trespass" (pl. aorist úcarer, úcarir attested). The noun #úcarë was the word used in Tolkien's final version of the Quenya Lord's Prayer; a draft version has #rohta (pl. rohtar) = "trespass" or "debt". Compare TRESPASSERS #rohtalië or #ruhtalië (i.e. "trespass-people", incorporating lië "people"?) from the same source. For other words for "trespasser" or "debtor", see DEBTOR. –VT43:19, 21
  TRESS findë (lock of hair) (probably obsoleting findil in LT2) –SPIN, LT2:341
  TRIANGLE neltil (stem neltild-, as in pl. neltildi), nasta (spear-head/spear-point, gore) –TIL, SNAS, VT46:14
  TRIBE hostar –LT2:340; the conceptual validity of this "Qenya" word may be questioned, since in later Quenya it looks like the pl. form of hosta "large number"
  TRICK (noun) rinca (twitch, jerk, sudden move) –VT46:11 cf. RIK(H)

  TURGON Turucáno (so in PM:345, obsoleting Turondo in LT1:115)
  TURN (transitive) quer-, attested as pa.t. quernë (VT49:20). Also with prefix nan- “back”, attested in the plural passive participle nanquernë “turned back” (sg. *nanquerna; compare nuquerna, see REVERSED). (VT49:17, 18, 20). *TURNED WESTWARD númenquerna (VT49:18, 20). English intransitive “to turn” requires a reflexive pronoun in Quenya: mo quernë immo *“one turned oneself” (VT49:6), in idiomatic English simply “one turned”.

  TURRET mindon (tower) –LT1:260
  TUSK carca (tooth, fang) –Silm:429, LT2:344  
  TWANG tingë, tango. LT1:256 has quingi- "twang, of strings, harp". In Etym, there is also the unglossed verb tanga-  = *"make a twang"??? –TING, TANG 
  TWELVE yunquë ("q"), archaic (pre-historic?) form yuncë (VT48:7, 8). Also (or in another conceptual phase, or in duodecimal counting?) #rasta (only the stem RÁSAT is given in the Etymologies, but cf. yurasta "24", i.e. 2 x 12, in PE14:17). For the syntax of numerals, see THREE. TWELVE HOURS ("day" when not meaning 24 hours) arya (day). (The word arya is however assigned other meanings in later sources, and aurë is given as the word for “day” meaning daylight period.)

  TWO atta. When constructed with a noun, atta follows and the noun is wholly uninflected: elen atta “two stars”. Case endings (the simplest, normally “singular” ones) are added to the numeral: genitive elen atto “of two stars”. –AT(AT)/Letters:427, VT48:6, VT49:44-45

  <U>
  UDÛN Utumno (stem *Utumnu-) –Silm:438

  UGLY úvanima (not fair). See also WITHOUT BEAUTY.-VT39:14
  ULCER: The early "Qenya" term sist with stem sisty- may perhaps be updated to LotR-style Quenya as *sistë with stem *sisti-. ULCERATED sistina (QL:86)
  ULTIMATE métima (final, last) –MC:222 cf. 215
  UN- (prefix denying presence or possession of thing or quality) ú- (no-, not, un-, in-) (according to LR:396 s.v. UGU, this prefix usually has a "bad sense", cf. vanimor "fair folk" vs. úvanimor "monsters"), il- (denoting "the opposite, the reversal, i.e., more than the mere negation"), also pretonic prefix la- "un-, not-". –VT39:14, UGU, UMU, LT1:255, VT45:25
 *UNCOUNTABLE únótima (pl. únótimë is attested). Translated "numberless"; the interlinear translation in RGEO:66 has "not-count-able", while VT39:14 offers the translation "countless". –Nam

  UNFOLDING (noun) pantië (opening, revealing) –QL:72
  UNFURL panta- (spread out, open) –PAT
  UNIVERSE ilu, ilúvë (the whole, the all, Allness). The term ilu used of the universe includes God and all souls and spirits, that are not properly included in the term Eä. The verb Eä, itself properly a verb “it is”, is also “used as noun = the whole created universe” (but “properly cannot be used of God since ëa refers only to all things created by Eru directly or mediately”). –ILU (see IL), VT39:20, VT49:28

  UP, UPWARDS amba, ama (prefix:) am-. (The "Qenya" form amu in LT2:335 is prob. obsolete.) "UP-POINT" (upper digit = "finger") ortil (ortill-, pl. ortilli given). UPWARD SLOPE amban; UPHILL (adj) ambapenda, ampenda  – AM2, UNU, VT47:10
  UPON – this English preposition may be rendered by the allative case, endings -nna pl. -nnar, dual -nta. Cf. falmalinnar "upon foaming waves", tielyanna "upon your path". –Nam, UT:22 cf. 51
  UPPER AIRS AND CLOUDS fanyarë (skies) –MC:223
  UPRISING (noun) ambaron, Ambarónë (sunrise, Orient) (a similar but untranslated word, Ambaróna, occurs in LotR:490). Rómen is glossed "uprising, sunrise, east" in Silm:437, but the normal meaning of the word is always "east". Cf. also: "UPRISING-FLOWER" *ambalotsë ("referring to the flower or floreate device used as a crest fixed to [the] point of a tall [illegible word, possibly 'archaic'] helmet", "pointed helm-crest". Tolkien asterisked the word because it was not attested, only a possible Quenya form of the name Amloth) –AM2, LotR:490, WJ:318
  URANUS Luinil (or less probably Nénar; it is not known for certain which of the two is Uranus and which is Neptune) –Basic Quenya:24, cf. Silm:55 
  URGE horta- (speed, send flying); URGING (noun, not adjectival participle) hortalë (speeding), URGENCY hormë –KHOR
  US: The exclusive pronoun (us = “I and some others, not you”) is me (suffixed to ála “do not” in álamë tulya, "do not lead us”, VT43:12, 22). This pronoun evidently connects with the ending -lmë, see WE. Inclusive "us" (i.e. "you and me") should apparently be *ve (for older we), connecting with the subject ending -lvë (older -lwë). If the pronouns me, *ve are stressed, the vowel may be lengthened (mé, vé, VT49:51). In another conceptual phase, Tolkien’s word for inclusive "we, us" may have been *ngwë (Third Age Quenya *nwë), VT48:11. The dual forms receive the ending -t, hence met, wet > *vet as the words for “us” referring to only two persons (exclusive met = “me and one other [not you]”; inclusive wet/*vet = “thee and me”). – Evidently me, *ve would be the same as subject and object, so that these forms could also be translated "we" as a short independent pronoun, and they can also receive case endings, e.g. attested forms like locative messë "on us", allative mello "from us", dative men "for us", allative véna “to us”. The forms atarmë, metermë "for us" also seem to include me, but these forms were evidently ephemeral ("for us", exclusive, is better rendered as men, itself an attested form). –Nam/RGEO:67, VT43:15, 19, VT44:18, VT49:14
  USE TONGUE, see TALK.
  USEFUL mára (fit, good) –MA3
  USUAL senwa (also senya; analogy would however suggest that *senya can also be the independent pronoun “his, her”; if so senwa may be preferred as the less ambiguous form). AS USUAL ve senwa, ve senya. –VT49:22

  VALLEY nan (nand-), tumbo (stem *tumbu-) (deep valley under/among hills, dark vale; so in Etym, Silm:438 and LT1:269. Letters:308 gives tumba "deep valley".) VALLEY (adj.) nalda (lowly), "VALLEY OF SINGING GOLD" Laurelindorinan (Lórien). –TUB, LotR:488 cf. Letters:308, LT1:261, UT:449

  VANISHED vanwa (gone, departed, dead, lost, past and over) –WAN, Nam, WJ:366
  VAST – LT2 gives aica "broad, vast", but aica is said to mean "sharp" in later writings. –LT2:338
  VEIL (vb) halya- (conceal, screen from light), fanta- (to cloak, mantle). "VEILS, RAYMENT" fana (pl fanar is attested. This word was used of the visible bodies in which the Valar presented themselves to incarnates.) VEILED halda (hidden, shadowed, shady) –SKAL, VT43:22, RGEO:74

  VOICE óma (pl instrumental ómainen "with voices" is attested. In some words, óma is translated "vowel", q.v.) VOICELESS ómalóra –OM, WJ:391, VT39:16 (the latter source defines óma as "voice, resonance of the vocal chords"), VT45:28

  VOMIT quama- (be ill) –QL:76 
  VOWEL #ómëa (only pl. ómëar attested), also #óma-tengwë, #ómatengwë (this term refers to vowels considered as independent phonemes, according to Fëanor's new insights on phonemics; only pl. ómatengwi is attested), óman (pl. "amandi" in LR:379 is a misreading for omandi, VT46:7; this term from the Etymologies may in any case be obsoleted by the above-mentioned forms), #lehta tengwë (lit. "free/relased element"; only pl. lehta tengwi is attested; we would rather expect *lehtë tengwi). (Note: In some compounds, óma seems to mean "vowel" instead of "voice": VOWEL SIGN #ómatehta (only pl ómatehtar is attested), DETERMINANT VOWEL sundóma, VOCALIC EXTENSION ómataina (q.v. for definition). Yet another term for "vowel", #penna pl. pennar, is given in VT39:16, but this is taken from a draft and not included in the final text Tolkien wrote. – The term #mussë tengwë "soft element" (only attested in the pl.: mussë tengwi) covers vowels, semi-vowels (y, w) and continuants (l, r, m, n). –VT39:8/16, OM, WJ:396, 319, 417, VT39:17

Silm:436: "ran- 'wander, stray'" and the following word:) WANDERING (noun) ránë (straying) (pl. probably *ráner not ráni; cf. the similar formation tyávë "taste" pl tyáver.) WANDERER Rána (a name of the Moon), #ran (isolated from Palarran "far-wanderer", the name of a ship) –RAN, Silm:436, UT:460, 461

  WAR ohta –OKTĀ, KOT
  WARM lauca –LAW
  WARRIOR ohtatyaro, ohtar, #mehtar (isolated from Telumehtar "Orion, warrior of the sky", a word occurring in LotR. Etym gives mahtar "warrior" under MAK, but Telumehtar not **Telumahtar under TEL). LT1:268 also has mordo "warrior, hero", but in Tolkien's later Quenya mordo means "obscurity, shadow, stain, smear, dimness". –KYAR (see KAR), UT:458, LotR:1146, MAK, TEL

  WATER nén (nen-) (LT1:262 also has linquë, but this word has other meanings in Tolkien’s later Quenya), WATER-FALL – LT1:249 gives axa, but this is probably obsoleted by axa "narrow path" in Etym; WATERY *nenda (wet – in the Etymologies as printed in LR, nenda seemed to be a Quenya word, but according to VT46:3 it actually appears as a primitive form nendā in Tolkien's manuscript; the Quenya form would still be *nenda, but it is unattested). WATER-MEAD, WATERED PLAIN nanda; WATER-LOVERS Nendili (used of the Lindar), WATER-VESSEL calpa; DRAW WATER calpa- (scoop out, bale out); ISSUE OF WATER ehtelë (fountain, spring, also cehtelë, see FOUNTAIN),  WATER FALLING OUT SWIFTLY FROM A ROCKY SPRING celussë (freshet), YELLOW WATER-LILY nénu –NEN, WJ:410, NAD, KALPA, KEL, UT:426, LT1:248 
  WAVE (crested), WAVE-CREST falma (partitive plural allative falmalinnar is attested. LT1:266 has solmë instead of falma.) –PHAL, VT42:15, Nam/RGEO:67
  WAX líco (evidently with stem *lícu-), neitë –MC:223, GL:60
  WAY tië (path, course, line, direction, road), #vanda (isolated form Qualvanda "Road of Death" in LT1:264; cf. vand- "way, path" on the same page) See ROAD. –TE3/RGEO:67, LT1:264
  WE, US: The relevant Quenya pronouns make two distinctions not found in English. “We” can be either inclusive or exclusive, depending on whether the party addressed is included in “we” or not. Furthermore, “we” can be either plural (involving at least three persons) or dual (involving only two persons, the speaker and one other). Tolkien repeatedly revised the relevant endings. According to VT49:16, 51 one late resolution goes like this: The ending for plural exclusive “we” is -lmë, corresponding to dual exclusive -mmë. Hence e.g. carilmë *“we [not including you] do”, carimmë *“the two of us do; I and one other [not you] do”. The ending for plural inclusive “we” is to be -lwë or -lvë, corresponding to -ngwë for dual inclusive “we” (VT49:16; variant -nquë in VT49:51): Carilwë “we [including you] do”, caringwë “the two of us do; thou and I do”. The corresponding independent pronouns were pl. exclusive me, pl. inclusive we or later ve with variant vi (PE17:130); when stressed these could have long vowels (mé and wé > vé, VT49:51). They may also appear in object position (“us” rather than “we”), e.g. suffixed to ála “do not” in the negative command álamë tulya, "do not lead us" (VT43:12, 22). If these pronouns are to be dual, they receive the dual ending -t (exclusive met, inclusive wet > *vet; compare imbë met “between us [two]” in Namarië). The dual pronouns do not have a long vowel even when stressed. The pronouns me, we/*ve and their long variants can also receive case endings, like dative men or véna “for us” (VT43:27, 28, 33, VT49:14) or locative messë "on us" (VT44:12). An emphatic pronoun is attested as emmë “we” (VT43:20), this reflects an earlier conceptual stage where Tolkien used the forms in -mmë for plural rather than dual exclusive “we” (VT49:48, cf. forms like vammë, WJ:371); presumably he would later regard emmë as a dual exclusive form, corresponding to pl. *elmë (and with *elwë > *elvë and *engwë as the emphatic pronouns for inclusive “you”, plural and dual, respectively). These emphatic pronouns can also receive case endings; the dative form emmen “for us” is attested (VT43:12, 20). – Genitive forms, see OUR; reflexive pronouns, see OURSELVES.
  WEAK milya (soft, gentle) (Note: milya- is also a verb "long for".) The adjectives nípa and *nimpë (the latter given in archaic form nimpi), meaning "small", are said to be used "usually with connotation of weakness". –VT45:34, VT48:18
  WEAL, WEALTH alma (good fortune), ausië, autë (prosperity, also adj: rich) WEALTHY herenya (blessed, fortuneate, rich) –GALA, LT2:336, KHER
  WEAPON carma (tool; the word may also mean “helm”). –PE17:114
  WEAR see BEAR. WEAR (OUT) yerya- (get old) (Note: yerya is also the adjective "old, worn") –GYER
  WEARY lumba –VT45:29
  WEATHER – dark weather: lúrë –LT1:259
  WEAVE lanya-; EVER-WEAVING Vairë (name of a Valië) –LAN, VT39:10
  WEB natsë (net); SPIDER'S WEB ungwë –NAT, LotR:1157
  WED verya-; the verb is intransitive and the person wedded appears in the allative (veryanen senna *”I married him/her”, compare English “get married to”). The word verya- also means “dare”, but since this is transitive and would always be followed by a direct object, the two verbs can be distinguished. – Transitive verta- means “to give in marriage” or “to take as husband or wife” (to oneself). In an earlier source, Tolkien gave the verb “to wed” as vesta-. Noun WEDDING veryanwë (going with verya- and verta-); in an earlier source, Tolkien gave this word as vestalë. Veryanwë is also attested with pronominal suffixes: veryanwesta, genitive veryanwesto “(of) your wedding”, with a dual form of “your”; also veryanweldo with a plural “your”. –VT49:45, BES, WED
  WEDGE nehtë (spearhead, gore, narrow promontory. Note: a homophone means "honeycomb".) –UT:282
  WEEK lemnar (from a root meaning "five", since the Valian week had five days), enquië (from a root meaning "six", since the Eldarin week had six days), otsola (evidently meaning a seven-day week like our own, as otso = "seven") –LEP, LotR:1141 cf. ÉNEK, GL:62
  WEEPING nyényë –LT1:262
  WEFT lanat, wistë –LAN , LT1:254
  WELL (adverb) mai –VT47:6
  WELL (noun): the form lón or lónë (pl. lóni given) has the partially illegible gloss "deep pool, or river-[?feeding] well". Early material has tampo “well”. –VT48:28. QL:93
  WENT lendë (departed) (past tense of lelya-/lenna- "go") LT1:264 gives vá, but this is probably not a valid word in LotR-style Quenya. –LED cf. VT45:27, WJ:363
  WEREWOLF nauro (In Etym, this word is spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if this word is written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) –NGAW
  WEST númen (so in Etym and LotR; Númen is capitalized in UT:305. According to VT45:38 the form núme- also occurs in Tolkien's Etym manuscript, and númë is attested in LT1:263 as well), andúnë (sunset, evening); WESTWARD númenna; WESTERN númenya; adj. IN THE WEST númëa; WESTLAND see WESTERNESSE; WESTLANDS Andustar (a region in Númenor) "WEST-WINGS" (the name of a ship) Númerrámar. TURNED WESTWARD númenquerna –LotR:1157/NDŪ, Nam,  UT:305, Silm:428, LT1:263, UT:165, 419, UT:175, 458, VT49:18, 20, 22
  WESTERNESSE, WESTLAND Númenor (full form Númenórë) –Silm:313, 414
  WET mixa, linquë (obsoleting liquin in LT1:262, but in later Quenya, linquë also means “hyacinth” or *”grass, reed”), *nenda (watery – in the Etymologies as printed in LR, nenda seemed to be a Quenya word, but according to VT46:3 it actually appears as a primitive form nendā in Tolkien's manuscript; the Quenya form would still be *nenda, but it is unattested.) –MISK, NEN, LINKWI
  WHAT, evidently mana as in mana i coimas Eldaron[?] "what is the coimas [lembas] of the Eldar?" (PM:396). See also WHO. Where "what" means "that which", it may be translated by a relative pronoun, as in lá carita i hamil mára "not to do what you judge good" –VT42:33
  WHAT IS MORE yëa, yé (Note: yé is also an interjection "lo! now see!"); see MOREOVER under MORE. –VT47:31
  WHEEL (spinning wheel) querma (also = turn-table) –PE17:65
  WHEN: The question-word “at what time?” is unattested, though paraphrases are possible (e.g. *mana i lú yassë menuvas? “what’s the time that he will go?” for “when will he go?”) “When” introducing a statement of time appears as írë in Fíriel’s Song (írë Anarinya queluva, “when my sun faileth”, LR:72). Another example has yá (in a phrase translated “when winter comes”, VT49:23), but different meanings (“formerly, ago”) are ascribed to the word yá elsewhere, possibly leaving írë less ambiguous (though this word itself must be distinguished from írë “desire”). In phrases like “the day when we came”, yassë “in which” may be used.
  WHENEVER quiquië, quië –VT49:23, 35
  WHEREIN yassen (refering back to a pl word; sg #yassë). See WHICH. –Nam, RGEO:66, 67
  WHEREUPON epeta, epta (following that, thence, thereupon) –VT49:12
  WHICH ya (known from the Arctic sentece and attested with a plural locative ending in Nam: yassen "which-in, wherein". See WHO concerning relative pronouns.) –Nam, RGEO:66
  WHINING miulë (mewing) –MIW
  WHIRLPOOL hwindë –SWIN
  WHISPER (vb) lussa-; WHISPERING SOUND lussë –SLUS (and because this is the basic root here, and Tolkien elsewhere indicated that older initial sl- produces Quenya hl-, it may be that these words should properly be cited as *hlussa-, *hlussë.)
  WHICH (relative pronoun) ya, yá; this relative pronoun may receive case endings, e.g. yassen "in which, wherein" (pl.) in Namárië. See THAT #3. – It is unclear what the interrogative "which" would be in Quenya; maybe mana "what" (?) can be substituted. –VT43:34, VT47:21
  WHITE ninquë (stem *ninqui-) (chill, pallid), fána/fánë (associated with the whiteness of clouds, fanyar), lossë (snow-white). –NIK-W-/GL:60/Silm:435 cf. WJ:417, SPAN/VT46:15, RGEO:69, MC:221-223
  WHO (interrogative pronoun) man (so in Nam and MC:222; MC:221 one place has men, but that is evidently an error, for man occurs in the same text. In FS and LR:59/63, man is translated "what". Either Tolkien later adjusted the meaning of the word, or man covers the meaning of both "who" and "what", but mana is seemingly attested in PM:396 as a distinct word for "what".) NOTE: this "who" is used only in questions. As for "who" as a relative pronoun, as in "the man who did this", see THAT #3. –Nam/MC:222
  WHOEVER aiquen (if anybody) –WJ:372
  WHOLE ilya (all), THE WHOLE ilúvë (the All, Allness, universe). According to early material, "the whole" (followed by some noun) is rendered by i quanda, e.g. *i quanda cemen "the whole earth" –IL, Silm:433, QL:70
  WHOLLY aqua (fully, completely, altogether) –WJ:392
  WICKED olca (bad). Compare ulca "evil", q.v. –VT43:23-24
  WIDE yonda (roomy, extensive), palla, landa; FAR AND WIDE palan (or "wide, over a wide space, to a distance", VT45:21); THE WIDE WORLD Palurin –PE17:43, PAL, LAD, Silm:435, LT1:264
  WIELD #tur- (cited in source as turin "I wield", 1st pers. aorist), pa.t. turnë (control, govern). WIELD, esp. WIELD A WEAPON mahta- (deal with, fight, handle, manage); pa.t. mahtanë is attested. –TUR, MAK/VT39:11, MA3, VT47:6, 18, 19, VT49:10
  WIFE veri, in earlier material also vessë (In UT:8, indis is translated "wife", but in Etym this word is glossed "bride".)  –VT49:45, BES, UT:8 cf. NDIS
  WILD verca; WILD BEAST hravan. Pl. Hravani the "Wild”, term used in Exilic Quenya to designate Men not belonging to the three houses of the Edain. –BERÉK, WJ:219, PE17:78
  WILDERNESS ráva (Note: a homophone means "riverbank"). The form ravanda (or possibly rovanda) mentioned in VT46:10 may be either a Quenya word or an etymological form cited to explain the "Noldorin" word rhofan. –RAB, VT46:10
  WILL (#1) (noun) níra (= "will" as a potential or faculty, while "act of will" is nirmë), *selma (Þ) ("a fixed idea, will". In WJ:319, the word is given as Þelma, but Þ (th) would become s in the Noldorin Quenya. Cf. Þindë, sindë in WJ:384) Other words for "will" turn up in Tolkien's various translations of "thy will be done" in the Lord's Prayer: indómë, replacing #mendë (mendelya "thy will"); according to VT43:16, Tolkien in his notes defined indómë as "settled character, also used of the 'will' of Eru". –VT39:30/VT41:6, 17; WJ:319, VT43:15-16
  WILL (#2) (verb) – as part of English circumlocutions expressing futurity, this verb will be rendered by the Quenya future tense in –uva, e.g. #maruva "will abide". WILL BE, see BE.
  WILL NOT – I will not: vá (exclamation, also = Do not!); avan, ván, vanyë "I won't", avammë, vammë "we won't" –WJ:371
  WILLOW-TREE tasar, tasarë (Þ) (probably obsoleting tasarin in LT2:346) –TATHAR/Silm:438
  WIND #súrë (Þ?) (instrumental form súrinen is attested, indicating a stem-form súri-), súlimë (Þ) (also the name of the month of March), vaiwa, waiwa (the latter is probably an older [MET] form); SOUND/NOISE OF WIND sú, WINDY wanwavoitë (pl. wanwavoisi) –MC:222 cf. 215, LT1:266, Nam/RGEO:66, VT47:12, WĀ, LT1:266
  WIND UP telya- (transitive) (conclude, finish) –WJ:411
  WINE miru, limpë (the drink of the Valar, or of the fairies). The word míruvórë, míruvor is defined as "a special wine or cordial.") –LT1:261, LIP, LT1:258, WJ:399
  WING ráma (Pl. rámar and plural instrumental form rámainen are attested. The form #rámë, occurring in the ship-name Eärrámë "Sea-Wing", evidently has a feminine ending.)
HAVING WINGS rámavoitë (pl. prob. *rámavoisi, cf. LEAPING, WINDY), "WEST-WINGS" (the name of a ship) Númerrámar –RAM/LT2:335, MC:222, Silm:295, UT:175, 458
  WINTER hrívë, in Tolkien’s early “Qenya” also Yelin, Hesin. In the Calendar of Imladris, hrívë was a precisely defined period of 72 days, but the word was also used without any exact definition. Lasselanta "leaf-fall" could be used for the beginning of winter, but the usual translation of this word is "autumn". "WINTER ONE" Hescil (a title of Nienna "who breedeth winter", LT1:66, 255) –LotR:1141, 1145; LT1:255, LT1:260
  WISDOM nolwë (secret lore, obsoleting nólemë in LT1:263), nólë (long study, lore, knowledge) (In Etym these words, as well as nóla below, are spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. Nólë is so spelt also in Silm:432. But if these words are written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) WISE #saila (isolated from alasaila "unwise"), nóla (learned), saira, istima (having knowledge, learned), iswa, isqua –NGOL, VT41:13, 18, Silm:432, IS, SAY/VT46:12, LT2:339
  WISH (vb) #mer- (cited in the form merë, evidently the 3rd person aorist; pa.t. given as mernë) (desire); WISH TO GO TO A PLACE mína- (desire to go in some direction, make for it, have some end in view). –MER, VT39:11
  WITCH (of the good magic) curuni –LT1:269
  WITH: For the purpose of Neo-Quenya writing, the best translation of "with" (in the sense of "together with") is probably #as, attested with a pronominal suffix (see below). A string of various prepositional elements meaning "with" are attested, but all are probably not meant to coexist in the same form of Quenya; rather Tolkien often changed his mind about the details. The preposition lé, le found in early material (QL:52) is probably best avoided in LotR-style Quenya (in which langauge le is rather the pronoun "you"). Tolkien later seems to be experimenting with yo and ó/o as words for "with"; yo hildinyar in SD:56 probably means *"with my heirs", and VT43:29 reproduces a table where various pronouns are suffixed to ó-, probably meaning "with" (óni *"with me", ólë *"with you", etc.) In the essay Quendi and Eldar, Tolkien assigns a dual meaning to ó- as a prefix; it was used "in words describing the meeting, junction, or union of two things or persons, or of two groups thought of as units" (WJ:367; cf. 361 regarding the underlying stem WO, said to be a dual adverb "together"). The plural equivalent of dual ó- is yo- (as in yomenië, WJ:407 cf. 361 regarding the underlying root JŌ), and it may seem to be this yo that occurs as an independent preposition in yo hildinyar in SD:56. The idea that ó- is a distinctly dual form does not appear in all sources; in VT43:29 we have forms like *ómë *"with us", implying at least three persons. In Tolkien's drafts for a Quenya rendering of the Hail Mary, he experimented with various prepositional elements for the phrase "with thee" (see VT43:29). A form carelyë was replaced with aselyë in the final version. Removing the ending -lyë "thee" and the connecting vowel before it leaves us with #as as the word (or a word) for "with"; this is ultimately related to the conjunction ar "and" (see VT43:30, 47:31). – In English, the preposition "with" may also have an instrumental force, which is best rendered by the Quenya instrumental case (e.g. *nambanen "with [= using] a hammer").
  WITHER hesta-, WITHERED hessa (dead) –LT1:255 
  WITHIN mi (see IN) –MI
  WITHOUT (adj & prep) ú (usually followed by genitive: ú calo "without light [cala]") (destitute of). WITHOUT BEAUTY úvanë, adj. úvanëa. (As for a suffix "-less", also glossed "without" by Tolkien, see entry –LESS.) –VT39:14
  WIZARD istar (nom. pl. istari and gen.pl. istarion are attested), sairon, curuvar WIZARDRY – in LT1:269, curu is glossed "magic, wizardry", but in Etym the gloss is simply "skill". –LotR:1121, UT:388, cf. IS, SAY; LT1:269
  WOLF ráca, narmo, WEREWOLF nauro; WOLFHOWL naulë (In Etym, narmo, nauro and naulë are spelt with initial ñ, that is, ng. Initial ng had become n in Third Age Quenya, and I follow the system of LotR and transcribe it accordingly. But if these words are written in Tengwar, the initial n should be transcribed with the letter noldo, not númen.) –DARÁK, NGAR(A)M, NGAW 
  WOMAN nís (so in MR:213, Etym gives nis, but both sources agree that the pl is nissi (the alternative pl. form nísi in VT43:31 seems abnormal, since this would be expected to become *nízi > *níri). A longer form of nís/nis is nissë, clashing with *nissë "in me". For clarity writers should probably use the short sg nís, as Tolkien himself does in MR:213, with the stem niss- before endings, as in the pl. nissi). At the end of compounds the form –nis may occur, as in Artanis (see NOBLE WOMAN). A poetic word for "woman" is †ní (female). The form #nína (gen. pl. nínaron attested, VT43:31) may have been but an ephemeral word for "woman" in Tolkien's conception. LARGE WOMAN nisto –NDIS/NĪ/NIS, MR:213, VT43:31, NĪ, INI, VT47:33
  WOMB #móna (isolated from mónalyo "of thy womb"). Another word, #carva, was possibly rejected by Tolkien. –VT43:31
  WONDER (noun) elmenda –PM13:143
  WON'T see WILL NOT
  WOOD toa (probably "wood" as a material rather than "wood" = "forest"; not to be confused with the homophone adj. toa "of wool, woollen"), GREAT WOOD taurë (pl. tauri is attested) (forest), wood as material: tavar (also toa), rough piece of wood: runda, piece of shaped wood: pano, smouldering wood (ember): yulmë (Note: yulmë also means "drinking, carousal") firewood: turu ("firewood" was the proper meaning, but the word was used for "wood" in general); OF WOOD taurina, WOODEN turúva, WOODEN POST samna (Þ); WOODEN HALL ampano, WOODPECKER tambaro, WOODLAND tavas (LT1:261 also gives nan(d), but this means "valley" in LotR-style Quenya.) –VT39:6, TÁWAR/Silm:438/MC:222 cf. 215, RUD, PAN, YUL, LT1:270, STAB, TAM, LT1:267
  WOOF winda –LT1:254
  WOOL tó (obsoleting oa in LT1:249; GL:71 has toa, but cf the following:) OF WOOL, WOOLLEN toa (not to be confused with the homophone toa "wood") –TOW
  WORD quetta (pl. quettar is attested. LT2:348 gives quent; this word is no doubt obsolete in LotR-style Quenya. GL:28 has "qetta-"). Quetië, literally *“saying”, is also translated “word” (or “words”) in one text. –Silm:436, WJ:391, VT49:28
  WORLD Ambar (earth), THE WIDE WORLD Palurin. (LT2 gives irmin "the world, all the regions inhabited by Men"; this is probably not a valid word in LotR-style Quenya.) OF THE WORLD marda (an adjective, *"wordly"); THE ENDING OF THE WORLD Ambar-metta, ambarmetta; "WORLD-ARTIFICER" Martamo (a title of Aulë) REDEEMER OF THE WORLD Mardorunando (it is not clear whether the initial element #mardo means "world" or "of the world"; cf. marda above. It may be that mardo is the genitive of mar, mard-, translated "earth" in Fíriel's Song.) –LotR:1003 cf. MBAR, VT44:36, LT1:251, 264, LT2:343, LT1:266, VT44:17
  WORN yerna (old [of things]), colla (passive participle of #col- "bear, *wear") (borne). The latter is also used as a noun = "vestment, cloak". –GYER, MR:385
  WORTH, WORTHY valda (dear) –GL:23
  WOSE Rú, Rúatan (pl Rúatani is given) –UT:385
  WOUND (vb) harna-; WOUNDED harna; WOUND (noun) harwë –SKAR

  WRIST málimë (literally "hand-link", má + #limë). Stem *málimi-, given primitive form mā-limi. –VT47:6
  WRITE #tec- (3rd pers. aorist tecë is given); noun WRITING sarmë (in the Etymologies also tengwë, but in a later source this word is said to mean "indication, sign, token", and this meaning may be predominant in Tolkien's later Quenya; pl tengwi is attested); WRITING SYSTEM tencelë (spelling); WRITINGS parma (book)  –VT39:8, TEK cf. WJ:394, 395, LT2:346
  WRONG raica (crooked, bent). INDUCEMENT TO DO WRONG #úsahtië (temptation), attested in the allative case (úsahtienna) –RÁYAK, VT43:23 
  
  <Y>
  YARD ranga (pl rangar is attested). The basic meaning of ranga was "full pace". This Númenórean linear measure was "slightly longer than our yard, approximately 38 inches [= 96.5 cm]". –UT:285, 461
  YAWN yanga-, #hac- (only attested as participle: hácala "yawning") –YAG, MC:222
  YEAR loa (lit. "growth"), coranar (lit. "sun-round", used when the year was considered more or less astronomically – but loa is stated to be the more usual word for "year"). The pl. coranári is attested (PM:126). LONG-YEAR yén (pl. yéni is attested in Nam; the Etymologies as printed in LR cite the stem-form as yen-, but according to VT46:22 Tolkien's manuscript actually has the pl. form yéni as in Nam). A "long-year" is a period of 144 solar years, an Elvish "century" – the Eldar used duodecimal counting, in which 144 is the first three-digit number, like our 100. But sometimes it seems that yén simply means "year". Cf the following words: LAST YEAR yenya, HAVING MANY YEARS linyenwa (old), *RECKONING OF YEARS Yénonótië –LotR:1141, YEN, MR:51
  YELLOW malina, tulca (the latter was adopted from Valarin and used in Vanyarin Quenya only),YELLOW POWDER malo (stem *malu-) (pollen) (note: a homophone means “moth”), "YELLOW HAMMER" (yellow bird) ammalë, ambalë, YELLOW WATER-LILY nénu –SMAL, WJ:399, LT1:248
  YES ná (literally "is", i.e. "[so it] is"), also (in the “past tense”) né, with reference to something past, i.e. “yes” =” it was so, it was as you say/ask”. Náto is possibly an emphatic form of “yes”. – In one conceptual phase, Tolkien used lá for "yes", but in both earlier and later material, lá is the negation "no, not" instead. –QL:64, VT42:33, VT49:18, 28-29, 31
  YESTERDAY noa (shortened from the full phrase noa ré “former day”; thus noa is basically an adjective “former”). In another conceptual phase, noa meant “tomorrow” instead. Not to be confused with noa “conception; idea”. –VT49:34
  YOKE yanta (bridge), yaltë –YAT, GL:37
  YON, YONDER (adj) enta (note: a homophone means "another, one more"); YONDER (interjection?) en (there, look!) –EN, VT45:12
  YOU (plural and dual only; for singular "you", see THOU): Plural “you” is normally expressed by the ending -ldë (VT49:51) that is added to verbs, e.g. carildë “you do” (VT49:16; in earlier texts Tolkien also used the ending--llë for pl. "you”, VT43:36, VT49:48). The reduced form -l may be attached to an imperative: hecal! "you be gone!" (WJ:364). Independent pronoun le, with long vowel (lé, VT49:51) when stressed. Case endings may be added, e.g. dative *len “for you” (cf. nin “for me”). YOUR (plural) is expressed by the ending -lda (VT49:16), e.g. onnalda “your child” (VT49:42); as an independent word perhaps *lenya (compare ninya “my” vs. ni “I”, nin “for me”). – Dual forms of YOU, used when addressing two persons: ending -stë (for original -dde, VT49:16, 33, 51), independent pronoun tyet (intimate/familiar) or let (polite/formal), YOUR (dual): ending -sta (VT49:16), as independent word perhaps *tyentya, *lentya derived from dual dative forms *tyent, *lent “for you (two)”. Compare such attested forms as ninya “my” and menya “our” vs. the dative pronouns nin “for me”, men “for us”.
